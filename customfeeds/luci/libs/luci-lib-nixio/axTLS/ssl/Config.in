config CONFIG_SSL_SERVER_ONLY
    bool "Server only - no verification"
    help
        Enable server functionality (no client functionality). 
        This mode still supports sessions and chaining (which can be turned
        off in configuration).

        The axssl sample runs with the minimum of features.
                
        This is the most space efficient of the modes with the library 
        about 45kB in size. Use this mode if you are doing standard SSL server
        work.

config CONFIG_SSL_CERT_VERIFICATION
    bool "Server only - with verification"
    help
        Enable server functionality with client authentication (no client
        functionality). 

        The axssl sample runs with the "-verify" and "-CAfile" options.

        This mode produces a library about 49kB in size. Use this mode if you
        have an SSL server which requires client authentication (which is 
        uncommon in browser applications).

config CONFIG_SSL_ENABLE_CLIENT
    bool "Client/Server enabled"
    help
        Enable client/server functionality (including peer authentication).

        The axssl sample runs with the "s_client" option enabled.

        This mode produces a library about 51kB in size. Use this mode if you
        require axTLS to use SSL client functionality (the SSL server code
        is always enabled).

config CONFIG_SSL_FULL_MODE
    bool "Client/Server enabled with diagnostics"
    help
        Enable client/server functionality including diagnostics. Most of the
        extra size in this mode is due to the storage of various strings that
        are used.

        The axssl sample has 3 more options, "-debug", "-state" and "-show-rsa"

        This mode produces a library about 58kB in size. It is suggested that 
        this mode is used only during development, or systems that have more
        generous memory limits.

        It is the default to demonstrate the features of axTLS.

config CONFIG_SSL_SKELETON_MODE
    bool "Skeleton mode - the smallest server mode"
    help
        This is an experiment to build the smallest library at the expense of
        features and speed.

        * Server mode only.
        * The AES cipher is disabled.
        * No session resumption.
        * No external keys/certificates are supported.
        * The bigint library has most of the performance features disabled.
        * Some other features/API calls may not work.

        This mode produces a library about 37kB in size. The main
        disadvantage of this mode is speed - it will be much slower than the 
        other build modes.

    bool "Low"
    help
        Chooses the cipher in the order of RC4-SHA, AES128-SHA, AES256-SHA.
      
        This will use the fastest cipher(s) but at the expense of security.

config CONFIG_SSL_PROT_MEDIUM
    bool "Medium"
    help
        Chooses the cipher in the order of AES128-SHA, AES256-SHA, RC4-SHA.
       
        This mode is a balance between speed and security and is the default.

config CONFIG_SSL_PROT_HIGH
    bool "High"
    help
        Chooses the cipher in the order of AES256-SHA, AES128-SHA, RC4-SHA.
        
        This will use the strongest cipher(s) at the cost of speed.

config CONFIG_SSL_USE_DEFAULT_KEY
    bool "Enable default key"
    depends on !CONFIG_SSL_SKELETON_MODE
    default y 
    help
        Some applications will not require the default private key/certificate
        that is built in. This is one way to save on a couple of kB's if an
        external private key/certificate is used.

        The private key is in ssl/private_key.h and the certificate is in
        ssl/cert.h.

        The advantage of a built-in private key/certificate is that no file
        system is required for access. Both the certificate and the private
        key will be automatically loaded on a ssl_ctx_new().
        
        However this private key/certificate can never be changed (without a
        code update).

        This mode is enabled by default. Disable this mode if the 
        built-in key/certificate is not used.

config CONFIG_SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_LOCATION
    string "Private key file location"
    depends on !CONFIG_SSL_USE_DEFAULT_KEY && !CONFIG_SSL_SKELETON_MODE
    help
        The file location of the private key which will be automatically
        loaded on a ssl_ctx_new().

config CONFIG_SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD
    string "Private key password"
    depends on !CONFIG_SSL_USE_DEFAULT_KEY && CONFIG_SSL_HAS_PEM
    help
        The password required to decrypt a PEM-encoded password file.

config CONFIG_SSL_X509_CERT_LOCATION
    string "X.509 certificate file location"
    depends on !CONFIG_SSL_GENERATE_X509_CERT && !CONFIG_SSL_USE_DEFAULT_KEY && !CONFIG_SSL_SKELETON_MODE
    help
        The file location of the X.509 certificate which will be automatically
        loaded on a ssl_ctx_new().

config CONFIG_SSL_GENERATE_X509_CERT
    bool "Generate X.509 Certificate"
    default n
    help
        An X.509 certificate can be automatically generated on a
        ssl_ctx_new(). A private key still needs to be provided (the private
        key in ss/private_key.h will be used unless 
        CONFIG_SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_LOCATION is set).

        The certificate is generated on the fly, and so a minor start-up time
        penalty is to be expected. This feature adds around 5kB to the
        library.

        This feature is disabled by default.

config CONFIG_SSL_X509_COMMON_NAME
    string "X.509 Common Name"
    depends on CONFIG_SSL_GENERATE_X509_CERT
    help
        The common name for the X.509 certificate. This should be the fully 
        qualified domain name (FQDN), e.g. www.foo.com.

        If this is blank, then this will be value from gethostname() and
        getdomainname().

config CONFIG_SSL_X509_ORGANIZATION_NAME
    string "X.509 Organization Name"
    depends on CONFIG_SSL_GENERATE_X509_CERT
    help
        The organization name for the generated X.509 certificate. 

        This field is optional.

config CONFIG_SSL_X509_ORGANIZATION_UNIT_NAME
    string "X.509 Organization Unit Name"
    depends on CONFIG_SSL_GENERATE_X509_CERT
    help
        The organization unit name for the generated X.509 certificate. 

        This field is optional.

config CONFIG_SSL_ENABLE_V23_HANDSHAKE
    bool "Enable v23 Handshake"
    default y
    help
        Some browsers use the v23 handshake client hello message 
        (an SSL2 format message which all SSL servers can understand). 
        It may be used if SSL2 is enabled in the browser.

        Since this feature takes a kB or so, this feature may be disabled - at
        the risk of making it incompatible with some browsers (IE6 is ok,
        Firefox 1.5 and below use it).

        Disable if backwards compatibility is not an issue (i.e. the client is
        always using TLS1.0)

config CONFIG_SSL_HAS_PEM
    bool "Enable PEM"
    default n if !CONFIG_SSL_FULL_MODE
    default y if CONFIG_SSL_FULL_MODE
    depends on !CONFIG_SSL_SKELETON_MODE
    help
        Enable the use of PEM format for certificates and private keys.

        PEM is not normally needed - PEM files can be converted into DER files
        quite easily. However they have the convenience of allowing multiple
        certificates/keys in the same file.
        
        This feature will add a couple of kB to the library. 

        Disable if PEM is not used (which will be in most cases).

config CONFIG_SSL_USE_PKCS12
    bool "Use PKCS8/PKCS12"
    default n if !CONFIG_SSL_FULL_MODE
    default y if CONFIG_SSL_FULL_MODE
    depends on !CONFIG_SSL_SERVER_ONLY && !CONFIG_SSL_SKELETON_MODE
    help
        PKCS#12 certificates combine private keys and certificates together in
        one file.

        PKCS#8 private keys are also suppported (as it is a subset of PKCS#12).

        The decryption of these certificates uses RC4-128 (and these
        certificates must be encrypted using this cipher). The actual
        algorithm is "PBE-SHA1-RC4-128".

        Disable if PKCS#12 is not used (which will be in most cases).

config CONFIG_SSL_EXPIRY_TIME
    int "Session expiry time (in hours)"
    depends on !CONFIG_SSL_SKELETON_MODE
    default 24 
    help
        The time (in hours) before a session expires. 
        
        A longer time means that the expensive parts of a handshake don't 
        need to be run when a client reconnects later.

        The default is 1 day.

config CONFIG_X509_MAX_CA_CERTS
    int "Maximum number of certificate authorites"
    default 4
    depends on !CONFIG_SSL_SERVER_ONLY && !CONFIG_SSL_SKELETON_MODE
    help
        Determines the number of CA's allowed. 

        Increase this figure if more trusted sites are allowed. Each
        certificate adds about 300 bytes (when added).

        The default is to allow four certification authorities.

config CONFIG_SSL_MAX_CERTS
    int "Maximum number of chained certificates"
    default 2
    help
        Determines the number of certificates used in a certificate
        chain. The chain length must be at least 1.

        Increase this figure if more certificates are to be added to the 
        chain. Each certificate adds about 300 bytes (when added).

        The default is to allow one certificate + 1 certificate in the chain
        (which may be the certificate authority certificate).

config CONFIG_SSL_CTX_MUTEXING
    bool "Enable SSL_CTX mutexing"
    default n
    help
        Normally mutexing is not required - each SSL_CTX object can deal with
        many SSL objects (as long as each SSL_CTX object is using a single
        thread).

        If the SSL_CTX object is not thread safe e.g. the case where a 
        new thread is created for each SSL object, then mutexing is required. 

        Select y when a mutex on the SSL_CTX object is required.

config CONFIG_USE_DEV_URANDOM
    bool "Use /dev/urandom"
    default y
    depends on !CONFIG_PLATFORM_WIN32
    help 
        Use /dev/urandom. Otherwise a custom RNG is used.

        This will be the default on most Linux systems.

config CONFIG_WIN32_USE_CRYPTO_LIB
    bool "Use Win32 Crypto Library"
    depends on CONFIG_PLATFORM_WIN32
    help 
        Microsoft produce a Crypto API which requires the Platform SDK to be
        installed. It's used for the RNG.

        This will be the default on most Win32 systems.

config CONFIG_OPENSSL_COMPATIBLE
    bool "Enable openssl API compatibility"
    default n
    help 
        To ease the porting of openssl applications, a subset of the openssl
        API is wrapped around the axTLS API.

        Note: not all the API is implemented, so parts may still break. And
        it's definitely not 100% compatible.

config CONFIG_PERFORMANCE_TESTING
    bool "Build the bigint performance test tool"
    default n
    help
        Used for performance testing of bigint.

        This is a testing tool and is normally disabled.

config CONFIG_SSL_TEST
    bool "Build the SSL testing tool"
    default n
    depends on CONFIG_SSL_FULL_MODE && !CONFIG_SSL_GENERATE_X509_CERT 
    help
        Used for sanity checking the SSL handshaking.

        This is a testing tool and is normally disabled.
