##
## KadNode is a P2P DNS resolver to resolve domains using the BitTorrent network.
##

config kadnode
	option enabled 1


## ECC Key usage:
## 1. Create public/secret key pair with `kadnode --bob-create-key /etc/kadnode_secret.pem`
## 2. Put the secret key file on the router that you want to resolve to and use it for option bob_load_key.
## 3. Use the public key hex output with .p2p attached on other devices to resovle to the router IP address via kadnode.

## Secret key for public key links
#	list bob_load_key '/etc/kadnode_secret.pem'


## TLS usage:
## For resolving domains, put credentials on the router and use option tls_client_cert.
## For announcing domains, put the certificates and secret key on router and use option tls_server_cert.

## Folder of CA certificates
## Install package 'ca-certificates' for the official CA set.
#	list tls_client_cert '/etc/ssl/certs'

## Server credentials
#	list tls_server_cert '/ect/mynode.crt,/etc/mynode.key'


## Add domains to be announced.
## Note: Only needed in special situations since tls_server_cert and bob_load_key announce automatically its associated domains.
#	list announce 'web.myname.p2p'

## Load and store good nodes every 24h and on start/shutdown.
#	option peerfile '/etc/kadnode/peers.txt'

## Add static peers addresses.
	list peer 'bttracker.debian.org:6881'
	list peer 'router.bittorrent.com:6881'

## Bind the DHT to this port.
#	option port '6881'

## Limit DHT communication to this interface.
#	option ifname 'eth0'

## Verbosity: quiet, verbose or debug
#	option verbosity 'quiet'

## Local port to accept forwarded requests.
#	option dns_port '3535'

## Disable multicast peer discovery on the LAN.
#	option lpd_disable '1'

## Disable port forwarding when this router is behind another
## router in a private network that supports UPnP/NAT-PMP.
#	option fwd_disable '1'
