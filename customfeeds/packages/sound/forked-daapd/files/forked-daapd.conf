# A quick guide to configuring forked-daapd:
#
# For regular use, the most important setting to configure is "directories",
# which should be the location of your media. Whatever user you have set as
# "uid" must have read access to this location. If the location is a network
# mount, please see the README.
#
# In all likelihood, that's all you need to do!

general {

	# Make sure the user has read access to the library directories you set
	# below, and full access to the databases, log and local audio

	# Sets who is allowed to connect without authorisation. This applies to
	# client types like Remotes, DAAP clients (iTunes) and to the web
