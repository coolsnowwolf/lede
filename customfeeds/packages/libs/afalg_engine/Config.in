    config AFALG_DIGESTS
	bool "Build support for digest acceleration"
	help
	    Digests are fast in software, and accessing AF_ALG adds latency, so
	    you'll need a large request (16KB) just to match software speed.
	    This increases memory usage, and has problems when process fork
	    with open digest contexts (openssh will not work because of it).

    config AFALG_FALLBACK
	bool "Enable software fallback feature"
	default y
	help
	    Use software to fulfill small requests.  Using AF_ALG adds latency,
	    which makes it slow to perform small requests.  Enabling this
	    option overcomes this problem, at the cost of increased memory
	    and CPU usage.  This is a new, experimental feature; if you
	    encounter any problem, this is the first option to disable.
	    The fallback will fail if you enable this engine alongside
	    devcrypto, so you'll not be able to install both at the same
	    time if this option is enabled.

    config AFALG_UPDATE_CTR_IV
	bool "Don't rely on kernel to update CTR IV"
	default y
	help
	    Don't count on the kernel driver to update the CTR-mode counter
	    (IV).  At least one driver does not update the IV as a workaround
	    for DMA issues.  With this option turned on, the engine will keep
	    track of the counter, and the IV will be sent with every update.
	    If fallback is enabled, then the counter needs to be updated by
	    the engine anyway, and sent with the request everytime there's a
	    switch from software to hardware, so this won't bring much gain in
	    that case.

    config AFALG_ZERO_COPY
	bool "Use Zero-Copy Mode"
	help
	    Uses a Zero-Copy interface.  Even though it is supposed to improve
	    performance, actual measurements indicate otherwise.
