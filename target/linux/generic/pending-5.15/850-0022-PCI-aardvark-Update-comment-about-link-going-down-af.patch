Subject: [PATCH] PCI: aardvark: Update comment about link going down after
 link-up
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Update the comment about what happens when link goes down after we have
checked for link-up. If a PIO request is done while link-down, we have
a serious problem.
