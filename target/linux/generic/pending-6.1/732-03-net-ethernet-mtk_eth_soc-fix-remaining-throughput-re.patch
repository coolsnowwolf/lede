Subject: [PATCH] net: ethernet: mtk_eth_soc: fix remaining throughput
 regression

Based on further tests, it seems that the QDMA shaper is not able to
perform shaping close to the MAC link rate without throughput loss.
This cannot be compensated by increasing the shaping rate, so it seems
to be an internal limit.

Fix the remaining throughput regression by detecting that condition and
limiting shaping to ports with lower link speed.

This patch intentionally ignores link speed gain from TRGMII, because
even on such links, shaping to 1000 Mbit/s incurs some throughput
degradation.
