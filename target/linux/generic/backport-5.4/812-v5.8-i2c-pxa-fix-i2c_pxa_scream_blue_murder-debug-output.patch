Subject: [PATCH 10/17] i2c: pxa: fix i2c_pxa_scream_blue_murder() debug output
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Disposition: inline
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"

The IRQ log output is supposed to appear on a single line.  However,
commit 3a2dc1677b60 ("i2c: pxa: Update debug function to dump more info
on error") resulted in it being printed one-entry-per-line, which is
excessively long.

Fixing this is not a trivial matter; using pr_cont() doesn't work as
the previous dev_dbg() may not have been compiled in, or may be
dynamic.

Since the rest of this function output is at error level, and is also
debug output, promote this to error level as well to avoid this
problem.

Reduce the number of always zero prefix digits to save screen real-
estate.
