Subject: [PATCH 616/660] net: sfp: fix sfp_bus_put() kernel documentation

The kbuild test robot found a problem with htmldocs with the recent
change to the SFP interfaces.  Fix the kernel documentation for
sfp_bus_put() which was missing an '@' before the argument name
description.

Fixes: 727b3668b730 ("net: sfp: rework upstream interface")
