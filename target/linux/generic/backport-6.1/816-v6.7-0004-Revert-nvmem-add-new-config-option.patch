Subject: [PATCH] Revert "nvmem: add new config option"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This reverts commit 517f14d9cf3533d5ab4fded195ab6f80a92e378f.

Config option "no_of_node" is no longer needed since adding a more
explicit and targeted option "add_legacy_fixed_of_cells".

That "no_of_node" config option was needed *earlier* to help mtd's case.

DT nodes of MTD partitions (that are also NVMEM devices) may contain
subnodes. Those SHOULD NOT be treated as NVMEM fixed cells.

To prevent NVMEM core code from parsing subnodes a "no_of_node" option
was added (and set to true in mtd) to make for_each_child_of_node() in
NVMEM a no-op. That was a bit hacky because it was messing with
"of_node" pointer to achieve some side-effect.

With the introduction of "add_legacy_fixed_of_cells" config option
things got more explicit. MTD subsystem simply tells NVMEM when to look
for fixed cells and there is no need to hack "of_node" pointer anymore.
