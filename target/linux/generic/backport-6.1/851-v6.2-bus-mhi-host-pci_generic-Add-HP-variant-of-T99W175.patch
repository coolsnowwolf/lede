Subject: [PATCH 02/13] bus: mhi: host: pci_generic: Add HP variant of T99W175

The Foxconn T99W175 modem has an HP variant, which has
the following output from lspci:

01:00.0 Wireless controller [0d40]: Device 03f0:0a6c

It also has some HP-specific serial numbers on the
metal case. It works well with this driver, so add
support for this to the pci_generic driver.
