Subject: [PATCH] net: phy: qca807x: move interface mode check to
 .config_init_once

Currently, we are checking whether the PHY package mode matches the
individual PHY interface modes at PHY package probe time, but at that time
we only know the PHY package mode and not the individual PHY interface
modes as of_get_phy_mode() that populates it will only get called once the
netdev to which PHY-s are attached to is being probed and thus this check
will always fail and return -EINVAL.

So, lets move this check to .config_init_once as at that point individual
PHY interface modes should be populated.
