Subject: [PATCH] nvmem: Do not expect fixed layouts to grab a layout driver
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Two series lived in parallel for some time, which led to this situation:
- The nvmem-layout container is used for dynamic layouts
- We now expect fixed layouts to also use the nvmem-layout container but
this does not require any additional driver, the support is built-in the
nvmem core.

Ensure we don't refuse to probe for wrong reasons.

Fixes: 27f699e578b1 ("nvmem: core: add support for fixed cells *layout*")
