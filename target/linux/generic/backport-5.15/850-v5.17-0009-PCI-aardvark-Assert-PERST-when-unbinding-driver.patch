Subject: [PATCH] PCI: aardvark: Assert PERST# when unbinding driver
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Put the PCIe card into reset by asserting PERST# signal when unbinding
driver. It doesn't make sense to leave the card working if it can't
communicate with the host. This should also save some power.
