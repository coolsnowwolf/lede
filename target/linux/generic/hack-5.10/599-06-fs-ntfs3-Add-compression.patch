Subject: [PATCH 06/11] fs/ntfs3: Add compression

This patch adds different types of NTFS-applicable compressions:
- lznt
- lzx
- xpress
Latter two (lzx, xpress) implement Windows Compact OS feature and
were taken from ntfs-3g system comression plugin authored by Eric Biggers
(https://github.com/ebiggers/ntfs-3g-system-compression)
which were ported to ntfs3 and adapted to Linux Kernel environment.

+/*
+ * make_huffman_decode_table() -
+ *
+ * Build a decoding table for a canonical prefix code, or "Huffman code".
+ *
+ * This is an internal function, not part of the library API!
+ *
+ * This takes as input the length of the codeword for each symbol in the
+ * alphabet and produces as output a table that can be used for fast
+ * decoding of prefix-encoded symbols using read_huffsym().
+ *
+ * Strictly speaking, a canonical prefix code might not be a Huffman
+ * code.  But this algorithm will work either way; and in fact, since
+ * Huffman codes are defined in terms of symbol frequencies, there is no
+ * way for the decompressor to know whether the code is a true Huffman
+ * code or not until all symbols have been decoded.
+ *
+ * Because the prefix code is assumed to be "canonical", it can be
+ * reconstructed directly from the codeword lengths.  A prefix code is
+ * canonical if and only if a longer codeword never lexicographically
+ * precedes a shorter codeword, and the lexicographic ordering of
+ * codewords of the same length is the same as the lexicographic ordering
+ * of the corresponding symbols.  Consequently, we can sort the symbols
+ * primarily by codeword length and secondarily by symbol value, then
+ * reconstruct the prefix code by generating codewords lexicographically
+ * in that order.
+ *
+ * This function does not, however, generate the prefix code explicitly.
+ * Instead, it directly builds a table for decoding symbols using the
+ * code.  The basic idea is this: given the next 'max_codeword_len' bits
+ * in the input, we can look up the decoded symbol by indexing a table
+ * containing 2**max_codeword_len entries.  A codeword with length
+ * 'max_codeword_len' will have exactly one entry in this table, whereas
+ * a codeword shorter than 'max_codeword_len' will have multiple entries
+ * in this table.  Precisely, a codeword of length n will be represented
+ * by 2**(max_codeword_len - n) entries in this table.  The 0-based index
+ * of each such entry will contain the corresponding codeword as a prefix
+ * when zero-padded on the left to 'max_codeword_len' binary digits.
+ *
+ * That's the basic idea, but we implement two optimizations regarding
+ * the format of the decode table itself:
+ *
+ * - For many compression formats, the maximum codeword length is too
+ *   long for it to be efficient to build the full decoding table
+ *   whenever a new prefix code is used.  Instead, we can build the table
+ *   using only 2**table_bits entries, where 'table_bits' is some number
+ *   less than or equal to 'max_codeword_len'.  Then, only codewords of
+ *   length 'table_bits' and shorter can be directly looked up.  For
+ *   longer codewords, the direct lookup instead produces the root of a
+ *   binary tree.  Using this tree, the decoder can do traditional
+ *   bit-by-bit decoding of the remainder of the codeword.  Child nodes
+ *   are allocated in extra entries at the end of the table; leaf nodes
+ *   contain symbols.  Note that the long-codeword case is, in general,
+ *   not performance critical, since in Huffman codes the most frequently
+ *   used symbols are assigned the shortest codeword lengths.
+ *
+ * - When we decode a symbol using a direct lookup of the table, we still
+ *   need to know its length so that the bitstream can be advanced by the
+ *   appropriate number of bits.  The simple solution is to simply retain
+ *   the 'lens' array and use the decoded symbol as an index into it.
+ *   However, this requires two separate array accesses in the fast path.
+ *   The optimization is to store the length directly in the decode
+ *   table.  We use the bottom 11 bits for the symbol and the top 5 bits
+ *   for the length.  In addition, to combine this optimization with the
+ *   previous one, we introduce a special case where the top 2 bits of
+ *   the length are both set if the entry is actually the root of a
+ *   binary tree.
+ *
+ * @decode_table:
+ *	The array in which to create the decoding table.  This must have
+ *	a length of at least ((2**table_bits) + 2 * num_syms) entries.
+ *
+ * @num_syms:
+ *	The number of symbols in the alphabet; also, the length of the
+ *	'lens' array.  Must be less than or equal to 2048.
+ *
+ * @table_bits:
+ *	The order of the decode table size, as explained above.  Must be
+ *	less than or equal to 13.
+ *
+ * @lens:
+ *	An array of length @num_syms, indexable by symbol, that gives the
+ *	length of the codeword, in bits, for that symbol.  The length can
+ *	be 0, which means that the symbol does not have a codeword
+ *	assigned.
+ *
+ * @max_codeword_len:
+ *	The longest codeword length allowed in the compression format.
+ *	All entries in 'lens' must be less than or equal to this value.
+ *	This must be less than or equal to 23.
+ *
+ * @working_space
+ *	A temporary array of length '2 * (max_codeword_len + 1) +
+ *	num_syms'.
+ *
+ * Returns 0 on success, or -1 if the lengths do not form a valid prefix
+ * code.
