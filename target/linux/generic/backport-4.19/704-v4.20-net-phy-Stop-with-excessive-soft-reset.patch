Subject: [PATCH 602/660] net: phy: Stop with excessive soft reset

While consolidating the PHY reset in phy_init_hw() an unconditionaly
BMCR soft-reset I became quite trigger happy with those. This was later
on deactivated for the Generic PHY driver on the premise that a prior
software entity (e.g: bootloader) might have applied workarounds in
commit 0878fff1f42c ("net: phy: Do not perform software reset for
Generic PHY").

Since we have a hook to wire-up a soft_reset callback, just use that and
get rid of the call to genphy_soft_reset() entirely. This speeds up
initialization and link establishment for most PHYs out there that do
not require a reset.
