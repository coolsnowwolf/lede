-* Qualcomm Atheros QCA8xxx switch family
-
-Required properties:
-
-- compatible: should be one of:
-    "qca,qca8328": referenced as AR8328(N)-AK1(A/B) QFN 176 pin package
-    "qca,qca8327": referenced as AR8327(N)-AL1A DR-QFN 148 pin package

-
-- #size-cells: must be 0
-- #address-cells: must be 1
-
-Optional properties:
-
-- reset-gpios: GPIO to be used to reset the whole device
-- qca,ignore-power-on-sel: Ignore power on pin strapping to configure led open
-                           drain or eeprom presence. This is needed for broken
-                           devices that have wrong configuration or when the oem
-                           decided to not use pin strapping and fallback to sw
-                           regs.
-- qca,led-open-drain: Set leds to open-drain mode. This requires the
-                      qca,ignore-power-on-sel to be set or the driver will fail
-                      to probe. This is needed if the oem doesn't use pin
-                      strapping to set this mode and prefers to set it using sw
-                      regs. The pin strapping related to led open drain mode is
-                      the pin B68 for QCA832x and B49 for QCA833x
-
-Subnodes:
-
-The integrated switch subnode should be specified according to the binding
-described in dsa/dsa.txt. If the QCA8K switch is connect to a SoC's external
-mdio-bus each subnode describing a port needs to have a valid phandle
-referencing the internal PHY it is connected to. This is because there's no
-N:N mapping of port and PHY id.
-To declare the internal mdio-bus configuration, declare a mdio node in the
-switch node and declare the phandle for the port referencing the internal
-PHY is connected to. In this config a internal mdio-bus is registered and
-the mdio MASTER is used as communication.
-
-Don't use mixed external and internal mdio-bus configurations, as this is
-not supported by the hardware.
-
-This switch support 2 CPU port. Normally and advised configuration is with
-CPU port set to port 0. It is also possible to set the CPU port to port 6
-if the device requires it. The driver will configure the switch to the defined
-port. With both CPU port declared the first CPU port is selected as primary
-and the secondary CPU ignored.
-
-A CPU port node has the following optional node:
-
-- fixed-link            : Fixed-link subnode describing a link to a non-MDIO
-                          managed entity. See
-                          Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/fixed-link.txt
-                          for details.
-- qca,sgmii-rxclk-falling-edge: Set the receive clock phase to falling edge.
-                                Mostly used in qca8327 with CPU port 0 set to
-                                sgmii.
-- qca,sgmii-txclk-falling-edge: Set the transmit clock phase to falling edge.
-- qca,sgmii-enable-pll  : For SGMII CPU port, explicitly enable PLL, TX and RX
-                          chain along with Signal Detection.
-                          This should NOT be enabled for qca8327. If enabled with
-                          qca8327 the sgmii port won't correctly init and an err
-                          is printed.
-                          This can be required for qca8337 switch with revision 2.
-                          A warning is displayed when used with revision greater
-                          2.
-                          With CPU port set to sgmii and qca8337 it is advised
-                          to set this unless a communication problem is observed.
-
-For QCA8K the 'fixed-link' sub-node supports only the following properties:
-
-- 'speed' (integer, mandatory), to indicate the link speed. Accepted
-  values are 10, 100 and 1000
-- 'full-duplex' (boolean, optional), to indicate that full duplex is
-  used. When absent, half duplex is assumed.

-		phy_port1: phy@0 {
-			reg = <0>;
