Subject: [PATCH] net: fix hangup on napi_disable for threaded napi

napi_disable() is subject to an hangup, when the threaded
mode is enabled and the napi is under heavy traffic.

If the relevant napi has been scheduled and the napi_disable()
kicks in before the next napi_threaded_wait() completes - so
that the latter quits due to the napi_disable_pending() condition,
the existing code leaves the NAPI_STATE_SCHED bit set and the
napi_disable() loop waiting for such bit will hang.

This patch addresses the issue by dropping the NAPI_STATE_DISABLE
bit test in napi_thread_wait(). The later napi_threaded_poll()
iteration will take care of clearing the NAPI_STATE_SCHED.

This also addresses a related problem reported by Jakub:
before this patch a napi_disable()/napi_enable() pair killed
the napi thread, effectively disabling the threaded mode.
On the patched kernel napi_disable() simply stops scheduling
the relevant thread.

v1 -> v2:
  - let the main napi_thread_poll() loop clear the SCHED bit
