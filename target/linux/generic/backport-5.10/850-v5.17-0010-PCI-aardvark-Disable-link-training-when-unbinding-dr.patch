Subject: [PATCH] PCI: aardvark: Disable link training when unbinding driver
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Disable link training circuit in driver unbind sequence. We want to
leave link training in the same state as it was before the driver was
probed.
