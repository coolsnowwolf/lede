Subject: [PATCH] net: phy: realtek: make sure paged read is protected by mutex

As we cannot rely on phy_read_paged function before the PHY is
identified, the paged read in rtlgen_supports_2_5gbps needs to be open
coded as it is being called by the match_phy_device function, ie. before
.read_page and .write_page have been populated.

Make sure it is also protected by the MDIO bus mutex and use
rtl821x_write_page instead of 3 individually locked MDIO bus operations.
