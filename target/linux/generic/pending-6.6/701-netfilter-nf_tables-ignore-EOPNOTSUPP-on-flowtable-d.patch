Subject: [PATCH] netfilter: nf_tables: ignore -EOPNOTSUPP on flowtable device
 offload setup

On many embedded devices, it is common to configure flowtable offloading for
a mix of different devices, some of which have hardware offload support and
some of which don't.
The current code limits the ability of user space to properly set up such a
configuration by only allowing adding devices with hardware offload support to
a offload-enabled flowtable.
Given that offload-enabled flowtables also imply fallback to pure software
offloading, this limitation makes little sense.
Fix it by not bailing out when the offload setup returns -EOPNOTSUPP
