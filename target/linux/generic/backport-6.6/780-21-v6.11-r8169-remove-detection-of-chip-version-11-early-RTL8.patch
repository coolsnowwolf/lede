Subject: [PATCH] r8169: remove detection of chip version 11 (early
 RTL8168b)

This early RTL8168b version was the first PCIe chip version, and it's
quite quirky. Last sign of life is from more than 15 yrs ago.
Let's remove detection of this chip version, we'll see whether anybody
complains. If not, support for this chip version can be removed a few
kernel versions later.
