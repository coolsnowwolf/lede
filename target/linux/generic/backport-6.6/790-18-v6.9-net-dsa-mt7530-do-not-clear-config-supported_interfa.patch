Subject: [PATCH 18/30] net: dsa: mt7530: do not clear
 config->supported_interfaces
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

There's no need to clear the config->supported_interfaces bitmap before
reporting the supported interfaces as all bits in the bitmap will already
be initialized to zero when the phylink_config structure is allocated. The
"config" pointer points to &dp->phylink_config, and "dp" is allocated by
dsa_port_touch() with kzalloc(), so all its fields are filled with zeroes.

There's no code that would change the bitmap beforehand. Remove it.
