Subject: [PATCH 10/30] net: dsa: mt7530: do not set priv->p5_interface on
 mt7530_setup_port5()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Running mt7530_setup_port5() from mt7530_setup() used to handle all cases
of configuring port 5, including phylink.

Setting priv->p5_interface under mt7530_setup_port5() makes sure that
mt7530_setup_port5() from mt753x_phylink_mac_config() won't run.

The commit ("net: dsa: mt7530: improve code path for setting up port 5")
makes so that mt7530_setup_port5() from mt7530_setup() runs only on
non-phylink cases.

Get rid of unnecessarily setting priv->p5_interface under
mt7530_setup_port5() as port 5 phylink configuration will be done by
running mt7530_setup_port5() from mt753x_phylink_mac_config() now.
