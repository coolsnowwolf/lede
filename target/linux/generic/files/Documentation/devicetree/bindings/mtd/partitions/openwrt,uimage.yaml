title: OpenWrt variations of U-Boot Image partitions

description: |
  The image format defined by the boot loader "Das U-Boot" is often
  modified or extended by device vendors. This defines a few optional
  properties which can be used to describe such modifications.

# partition.txt defines common properties, but has not yet been
# converted to YAML
#allOf:
#  - $ref: ../partition.yaml#

properties:
  compatible:
    items:
      - enum:
          - openwrt,uimage
      - const: denx,uimage

  openwrt,padding:
    description: Number of padding bytes between header and data
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    default: 0

  openwrt,ih-magic:
    description: U-Boot Image Header magic number.
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    default: 0x27051956 # IH_MAGIC

  openwrt,ih-type:
    description: U-Boot Image type
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    default: 2 # IH_TYPE_KERNEL

  openwrt,offset:
    description:
      Offset between partition start and U-Boot Image in bytes
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    default: 0

  openwrt,partition-magic:
    description:
      Magic number found at the start of the partition. Will only be
      validated if both this property and openwrt,offset is non-zero
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    default: 0
