Subject: [RFC net-next 7/7] net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Request assisted learning on CPU port
Date:   Sat, 16 Jan 2021 02:25:15 +0100
Archived-At: <https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20210116012515.3152-8-tobias@waldekranz.com/>

While the hardware is capable of performing learning on the CPU port,
it requires alot of additions to the bridge's forwarding path in order
to handle multi-destination traffic correctly.

Until that is in place, opt for the next best thing and let DSA sync
the relevant addresses down to the hardware FDB.
