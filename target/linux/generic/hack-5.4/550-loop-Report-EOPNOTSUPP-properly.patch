Subject: loop: Report EOPNOTSUPP properly

Properly plumb out EOPNOTSUPP from loop driver operations, which may
get returned when for instance a discard operation is attempted but not
supported by the underlying block device. Before this change, everything
was reported in the log as an I/O error, which is scary and not
helpful in debugging.
