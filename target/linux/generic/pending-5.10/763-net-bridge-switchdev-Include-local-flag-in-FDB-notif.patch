Subject: [PATCH] net: bridge: switchdev: Include local flag in FDB
 notifications

Some switchdev drivers, notably DSA, ignore all dynamically learned
address notifications (!added_by_user) as these are autonomously added
by the switch. Previously, such a notification was indistinguishable
from a local address notification. Include a local bit in the
notification so that the two classes can be discriminated.

This allows DSA-like devices to add local addresses to the hardware
FDB (with the CPU as the destination), thereby avoiding flows towards
the CPU being flooded by the switch as unknown unicast.
