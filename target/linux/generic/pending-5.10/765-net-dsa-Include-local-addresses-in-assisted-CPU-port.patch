Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: Include local addresses in assisted CPU port
 learning

Add local addresses (i.e. the ports' MAC addresses) to the hardware
FDB when assisted CPU port learning is enabled.

NOTE: The bridge's own MAC address is also "local". If that address is
not shared with any port, the bridge's MAC is not be added by this
functionality - but the following commit takes care of that case.
