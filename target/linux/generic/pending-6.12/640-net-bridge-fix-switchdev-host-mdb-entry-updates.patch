Subject: [PATCH] net: bridge: fix switchdev host mdb entry updates

When a mdb entry is removed, the bridge switchdev code can issue a
switchdev_port_obj_del call for a port that was not offloaded.

This leads to an imbalance in switchdev_port_obj_add/del calls, since
br_switchdev_mdb_replay has not been called for the port before.

This can lead to potential multicast forwarding issues and messages such as:
mt7915e 0000:01:00.0 wl1-ap0: Failed to del Host Multicast Database entry
	(object id=3) with error: -ENOENT (-2).

Fix this issue by checking the port offload status when iterating over
lower devs.
