Subject: [PATCH 1/2] mtd: spi-nor: locking support for MX25L6405D

Macronix MX25L6405D supports locking with four block-protection bits.
Currently, the driver only sets three bits.  If the bootloader does not
sustain the flash chip in an unlocked state, the flash might be
non-writeable. Add the corresponding flag to enable locking support with
four bits in the status register.

Tested on Nanostation M2 XM.

Similar to commit 7ea40b54e83b ("mtd: spi-nor: enable locking support for
MX25L12805D")
