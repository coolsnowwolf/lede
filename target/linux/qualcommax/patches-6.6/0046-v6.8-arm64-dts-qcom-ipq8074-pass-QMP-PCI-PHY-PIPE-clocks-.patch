Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: ipq8074: pass QMP PCI PHY PIPE clocks to
 GCC

Pass QMP PCI PHY PIPE clocks to the GCC controller so it does not have to
find them by matching globaly by name.

If not passed directly, driver maintains backwards compatibility by then
falling back to global lookup.
