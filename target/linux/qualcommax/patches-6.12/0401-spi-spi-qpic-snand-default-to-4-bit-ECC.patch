Subject: [PATCH] spi: spi-qpic-snand: default to 4-bit ECC

There are NAND IC-s that define 1-bit ECC as the minimal strength,
however that is unsupported by QPIC-SNAND as it only supports 4 or 8 bit
ECC.

Since most of these chips also support 4-bit ECC just fine, instead of
erroring out if 1-bit ECC is requested lets instead default to 4-bit ECC.

Fixes: 01b72ce61e8f ("qualcommax: ipq50xx: remove ECC user config from board files")
