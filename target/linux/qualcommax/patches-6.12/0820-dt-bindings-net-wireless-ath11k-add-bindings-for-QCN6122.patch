Subject: [PATCH] dt: bindings: net: add bindings for QCN6122

QCN6122 is a PCIe based solution that is attached to and enumerated
by the WPSS (Wireless Processor SubSystem) Q6 processor.

Though it is a PCIe device, since it is not attached to APSS processor
(Application Processor SubSystem), APSS will be unaware of such a decice
and hence it is registered to the APSS processor as a platform device(AHB).
Because of this hybrid nature, it is called as a hybrid bus device.

As such, QCN6122 is a hybrid bus type device and follows the same codepath
as for WCN6750.

This is a reversed engineered and heavily simplified version of below
downstream patch:
