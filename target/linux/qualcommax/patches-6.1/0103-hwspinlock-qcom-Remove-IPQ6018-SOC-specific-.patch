Subject: [PATCH] hwspinlock: qcom: Remove IPQ6018 SOC specific compatible

IPQ6018 has 32 tcsr_mutex hwlock registers with stride 0x1000.
The compatible string qcom,ipq6018-tcsr-mutex is mapped to
of_msm8226_tcsr_mutex which has 32 locks configured with stride of 0x80
and doesn't match the HW present in IPQ6018.

Remove IPQ6018 specific compatible string so that it fallsback to
of_tcsr_mutex data which maps to the correct configuration for IPQ6018.
