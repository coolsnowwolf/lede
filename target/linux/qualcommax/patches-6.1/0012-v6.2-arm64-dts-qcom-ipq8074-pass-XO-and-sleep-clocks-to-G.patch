Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: ipq8074: pass XO and sleep clocks to GCC

Pass XO and sleep clocks to the GCC controller so it does not have to
find them by matching globaly by name.

If not passed directly, driver maintains backwards compatibility by then
falling back to global lookup.

Since we are here, set cell numbers in decimal instead of hex.
