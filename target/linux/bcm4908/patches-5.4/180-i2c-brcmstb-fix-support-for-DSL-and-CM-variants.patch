Subject: [PATCH] i2c: brcmstb: fix support for DSL and CM variants
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

DSL and CM (Cable Modem) support 8 B max transfer size and have a custom
DT binding for that reason. This driver was checking for a wrong
"compatible" however which resulted in an incorrect setup.

Fixes: e2e5a2c61837 ("i2c: brcmstb: Adding support for CM and DSL SoCs")
