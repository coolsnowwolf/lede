This Malta target is intended to be used with the Qemu emulator. It can be used
to prototype an OpenWrt firmware for MIPS processors. One could also use it to
troubleshoot MIPS applications without access to real hardware.

To use the images built by OpenWrt with qemu, use the following commands:

For the 32 bit little-endian image:
qemu-system-mipsel -kernel bin/targets/malta/le/openwrt-malta-le-vmlinux-initramfs.elf -nographic -m 256

For the 32 bit big-endian image:
qemu-system-mips -kernel bin/targets/malta/be/openwrt-malta-be-vmlinux-initramfs.elf -nographic -m 256

For the 64 bit little-endian image:
qemu-system-mips64el -kernel bin/targets/malta/le64/openwrt-malta-le64-vmlinux-initramfs.elf -cpu MIPS64R2-generic -nographic -m 256

For the 64 bit big-endian image:
qemu-system-mips64 -kernel bin/targets/malta/be64/openwrt-malta-be64-vmlinux-initramfs.elf -cpu MIPS64R2-generic -nographic -m 256

and enjoy the system bootin.
