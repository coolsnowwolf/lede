Subject: [PATCH 33/41] firmware: qcom_scm: use 64-bit calling convention only
 when client is 64-bit

Per the "SMC calling convention specification", the 64-bit calling
convention can only be used when the client is 64-bit. Whereas the
32-bit calling convention can be used by either a 32-bit or a 64-bit
client.

Currently during SCM probe, irrespective of the client, 64-bit calling
convention is made, which is incorrect and may lead to the undefined
behaviour when the client is 32-bit. Let's fix it.
