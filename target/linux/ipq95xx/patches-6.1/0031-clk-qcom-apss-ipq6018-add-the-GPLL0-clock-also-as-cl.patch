Subject: [PATCH 31/41] clk: qcom: apss-ipq6018: add the GPLL0 clock also as
 clock provider

While the kernel is booting up, APSS PLL will be running at 800MHz with
GPLL0 as source. Once the cpufreq driver is available, APSS PLL will be
configured and select the rate based on the opp table and the source will
be changed to APSS_PLL_EARLY.

Without this patch, CPU Freq driver reports that CPU is running at 24MHz
instead of the 800MHz.
