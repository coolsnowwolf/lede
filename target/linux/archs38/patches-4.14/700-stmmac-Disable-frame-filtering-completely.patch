Subject: [PATCH] stmmac: Disable frame filtering completely

For some [still unknown] reason in ARC SDP boards
DW GMAC doesn't enter promiscuous mode if eth0 gets
added to the br-lan interface before Ethernet PHY finishes
autonegotiation (PHY gets reset on DW GMAC start).

As a work-around we completely disable frame filtering
in GMAC hardware which gives us working bridge that consists
of eth0 and wlan0 (USB Wi-Fi dongle). I.e. we finally have
working "Dumb AP" setup made of ARC AXS10x boards.
