Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: usb: snps,dwc3: add FS/HS periodic NAK polling
 quirk

Add two quirk properties that control whether or not the controller
issues many more handshakes to FS/HS Async endpoints in a single
(micro)frame. Enabling these can significantly increase throughput for
endpoints that frequently respond with NAKs.
