Subject: [PATCH] drm/vc4: Use the TPZ scaling filter for 1x1 source images

The documentation says that the TPZ filter can not upscale,
and requesting a scaling factor > 1:1 will output the original
image in the top left, and repeat the right/bottom most pixels
thereafter.
That fits perfectly with upscaling a 1x1 image which is done
a fair amount by some compositors to give solid colour, and it
saves a large amount of LBM (TPZ is based on src size, whilst
PPF is based on dest size).

Select TPZ filter for images with source rectangle <=1.
