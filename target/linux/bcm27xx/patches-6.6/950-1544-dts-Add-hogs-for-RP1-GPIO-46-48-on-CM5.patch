Subject: [PATCH] dts: Add hogs for RP1 GPIO 46/48 on CM5

On Pi5 5, GPIOs 46/48 are made available on the 'CAM/DISP 1' connector as
'CD1_IO0_MICCLK'/'CD1_IO1_MICDAT1'. These GPIOs are not connected on
CM5.

Add hogs for GPIO 46/48 on CM5 to prevent camera drivers from
inadvertently using them when connected to 'CAM/DISP 1'
