ASoC: Add support for Rpi-DAC

ASoC: Add prompt for ICS43432 codec

Without a prompt string, a config setting can't be included in a
defconfig. Give CONFIG_SND_SOC_ICS43432 a prompt so that Pi soundcards
can use the driver.

Add IQaudIO Sound Card support for Raspberry Pi

Set a limit of 0dB on Digital Volume Control

The main volume control in the PCM512x DAC has a range up to
+24dB. This is dangerously loud and can potentially cause massive
clipping in the output stages. Therefore this sets a sensible
limit of 0dB for this control.

Allow up to 24dB digital gain to be applied when using IQAudIO DAC+

24db_digital_gain DT param can be used to specify that PCM512x
codec "Digital" volume control should not be limited to 0dB gain,
and if specified will allow the full 24dB gain.

Modify IQAudIO DAC+ ASoC driver to set card/dai config from dt

Add the ability to set the card name, dai name and dai stream name, from
dt config.

IQaudIO: auto-mute for AMP+ and DigiAMP+

IQAudIO amplifier mute via GPIO22. Add dt params for "one-shot" unmute
and auto mute.

Revision 2, auto mute implementing HiassofT suggestion to mute/unmute
using set_bias_level, rather than startup/shutdown....
"By default DAPM waits 5 seconds (pmdown_time) before shutting down
playback streams so a close/stop immediately followed by open/start
doesn't trigger an amp mute+unmute."

Tested on both AMP+ (via DAC+) and DigiAMP+, with both options...

dtoverlay=iqaudio-dacplus,unmute_amp
 "one-shot" unmute when kernel module loads.

dtoverlay=iqaudio-dacplus,auto_mute_amp
 Unmute amp when ALSA device opened by a client. Mute, with 5 second delay
 when ALSA device closed. (Re-opening the device within the 5 second close
 window, will cancel mute.)

Revision 4, using gpiod.

Revision 5, clean-up formatting before adding mute code.
 - Convert tab plus 4 space formatting to 2x tab
 - Remove '// NOT USED' commented code

Revision 6, don't attempt to "one-shot" unmute amp, unless card is
successfully registered.

Added support for HiFiBerry DAC+

The driver is based on the HiFiBerry DAC driver. However HiFiBerry DAC+ uses
a different codec chip (PCM5122), therefore a new driver is necessary.

Add support for the HiFiBerry DAC+ Pro.

The HiFiBerry DAC+ and DAC+ Pro products both use the existing bcm sound driver with the DAC+ Pro having a special clock device driver representing the two high precision oscillators.

An addition bug fix is included for the PCM512x codec where by the physical size of the sample frame is used in the calculation of the LRCK divisor as it was found to be wrong when using 24-bit depth sample contained in a little endian 4-byte sample frame.

Limit PCM512x "Digital" gain to 0dB by default with HiFiBerry DAC+

24db_digital_gain DT param can be used to specify that PCM512x
codec "Digital" volume control should not be limited to 0dB gain,
and if specified will allow the full 24dB gain.

Add dt param to force HiFiBerry DAC+ Pro into slave mode

"dtoverlay=hifiberry-dacplus,slave"

Add 'slave' param to use HiFiBerry DAC+ Pro in slave mode,
with Pi as master for bit and frame clock.

ASoC: pcm512x: revert downstream changes

This partially reverts commit 185ea05465aac8bf02a0d2b2f4289d42c72870b7
which was added by https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/pull/1152

The downstream pcm512x changes caused a regression, it broke normal
use of the 24bit format with the codec, eg when using simple-audio-card.

The actual bug with 24bit playback is the incorrect usage
of physical_width in various drivers in the downstream tree
which causes 24bit data to be transmitted with 32 clock
cycles. So it's not the pcm512x that needs fixing, it's the
soundcard drivers.

New AudioInjector.net Pi soundcard with low jitter audio in and out.

Contains the sound/soc/bcm ALSA machine driver and necessary alterations to the Kconfig and Makefile.
Adds the dts overlay and updates the Makefile and README.
Updates the relevant defconfig files to enable building for the Raspberry Pi.
Thanks to Phil Elwell (pelwell) for the review, simple-card concepts and discussion. Thanks to Clive Messer for overlay naming suggestions.

Added support for headphones, microphone and bclk_ratio settings.

This patch adds headphone and microphone capability to the Audio Injector sound card. The patch also sets the bit clock ratio for use in the bcm2835-i2s driver. The bcm2835-i2s can't handle an 8 kHz sample rate when the bit clock is at 12 MHz because its register is only 10 bits wide which can't represent the ch2 offset of 1508. For that reason, the rate constraint is added.

3. Move the declaration of the clock node in the overlay outside
the I2C node to avoid warnings.

4. Sort the overlay nodes so that dependencies are only to earlier

TAS5713: return error if initialisation fails

Existing TAS5713 driver logs errors during initialisation, but does not return
an error code. Therefore even if initialisation fails, the driver will still be
loaded, but won't work. This patch fixes this. I2C communication error will now
reported correctly by a non-zero return code.

HiFiBerry Amp: fix device-tree problems

Some code to load the driver based on device-tree-overlays was missing. This is added by this patch.

According to 5713 pdf doc CLOCK_CTRL is a readonly status register, and it behaves so. Remove useless setting

sound: pcm512x-codec: Adding 352.8kHz samplerate support

sound/soc: only first codec is master in multicodec setup

When using multiple codecs, at most one codec should generate the master
clock. All codecs except the first are therefore configured for slave
mode.

rpi sound cards: Fix Codec Zero rate switching

The Raspberry Pi Codec Zero (and IQaudIO Codec) don't notify the DA7213
codec when it needs to change PLL frequencies. As a result, audio can
be played at the wrong rate - play a 48kHz sound immediately after a
44.1kHz sound to see the effect, but in some configurations the codec
can lock into the wrong state and always get some rates wrong.

Add the necessary notification to fix the issue.
