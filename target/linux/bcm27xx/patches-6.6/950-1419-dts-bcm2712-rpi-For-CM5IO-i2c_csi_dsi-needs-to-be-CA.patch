Subject: [PATCH] dts: bcm2712-rpi: For CM5IO, i2c_csi_dsi needs to be
 CAM/DISP1

Noted setting up a display on CM5IO. Add
"dtoverlay=vc4-kms-dsi-ili7881-7inch" fails as it tries to
find the regulator/backlight/touch on i2c_csi_dsi, which pointed
at i2c_csi_dsi0 by default.

Adding the dsi0 override updated to point at dsi0, and pointed
the i2c at i2c_csi_dsi0, which all works.

The default with i2c_csi_dsi needs to be consistent in using
dsi1/csi1 and the corresponding i2c interface (i2c_csi_dsi1).
