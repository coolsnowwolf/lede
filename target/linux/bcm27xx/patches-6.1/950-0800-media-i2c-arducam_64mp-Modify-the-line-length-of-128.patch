Subject: [PATCH] media: i2c: arducam_64mp: Modify the line length of 1280x720
 resolution

Arducam 64MP has specific requirements for the line length, and if these
conditions are not met, the camera will not function properly. Under the
previous configuration, once a stream off operation is performed, the
camera will not output any data, even if a stream on operation is
performed. This prevents us from switching from 1280x720 to another
resolution.
