Subject: [PATCH] drm/panel/raspberrypi-touchscreen: Insert more delays.

This avoids failures in cases where the panel is enabled
or re-probed very soon after being disabled or probed.
These can occur because the Atmel device can mis-behave
over I2C for a few ms after any write to the POWERON register.
