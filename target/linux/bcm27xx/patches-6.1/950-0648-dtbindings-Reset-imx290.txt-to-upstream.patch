 * Sony IMX290 1/2.8-Inch CMOS Image Sensor
 
 The Sony IMX290 is a 1/2.8-Inch CMOS Solid-state image sensor with
-Square Pixel for Color or Monochrome Cameras. It is programmable through I2C
-and 4-wire interfaces.
-The sensor output is available via CMOS logic parallel SDR output,
+Square Pixel for Color Cameras. It is programmable through I2C and 4-wire
+interfaces. The sensor output is available via CMOS logic parallel SDR output,
 Low voltage LVDS DDR output and CSI-2 serial data output. The CSI-2 bus is the
 default. No bindings have been defined for the other busses.
