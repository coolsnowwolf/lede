Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: bcm283x: Unify CMA configuration

commit c5a1e5375d19bd4001c59dc5d482ac5b1ba51cbf upstream.

With the introduction of the Raspberry Pi 4 we were forced to explicitly
configure CMA's location, since arm64 defaults it into the ZONE_DMA32
memory area, which is not good enough to perform DMA operations on that
device. To bypass this limitation a dedicated CMA DT node was created,
explicitly indicating the acceptable memory range and size.

That said, compatibility between boards is a must on the Raspberry Pi
ecosystem so this creates a common CMA DT node so as for DT overlays to
be able to update CMA's properties regardless of the board being used.
