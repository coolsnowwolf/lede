Subject: [PATCH] media: ov5647: Fix return codes from
 ov5647_write/ov5647_read functions.

Previously they were returning positive non-zero codes for success,
which were getting passed up the call stack. Since release 4.19,
do_dentry_open (fs/open.c) has been catching these and flagging an
error. (So this driver has been broken since that date.)

Fixes: 3c2472a [media] media: i2c: Add support for OV5647 sensor
