Subject: [PATCH] drm/vc4: hdmi: Only call into DRM framework if
 registered

Our hotplug handler will currently call the drm_kms_helper_hotplug_event
every time a hotplug interrupt is called.

However, since the device is registered after all the drivers have
finished their bind callback, we have a window between when we install
our interrupt handler and when drm_dev_register() is eventually called
where our handler can run and call drm_kms_helper_hotplug_event but the
device hasn't been registered yet, causing a null pointer dereference.

Fix this by making sure we only call drm_kms_helper_hotplug_event if our
device has been properly registered.
