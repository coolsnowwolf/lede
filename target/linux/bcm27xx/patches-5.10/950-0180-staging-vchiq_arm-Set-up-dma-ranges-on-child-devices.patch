Subject: [PATCH] staging: vchiq_arm: Set up dma ranges on child
 devices

The VCHIQ driver now loads the audio, camera, codec, and vc-sm
drivers as platform drivers. However they were not being given
the correct DMA configuration.

Call of_dma_configure with the parent (VCHIQ) parameters to be
inherited by the child.
