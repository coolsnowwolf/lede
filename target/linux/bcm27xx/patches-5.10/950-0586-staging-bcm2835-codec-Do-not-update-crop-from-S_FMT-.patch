Subject: [PATCH] staging/bcm2835-codec: Do not update crop from S_FMT
 after res change

During decode, setting the CAPTURE queue format was setting the crop
rectangle to the requested height before aligning up the format to
cater for simple clients that weren't expecting to deal with cropping
and the SELECTION API.
This caused problems on some resolution change events if the client
didn't also then use the selection API.

Disable the crop update after a resolution change.
