Subject: [PATCH] overlays: seeed-can-fd-hat: clarify how to identify
 HAT version

It turns out the used CAN SPI chip is not a good way to identify the version of
the CAN HAT.

There are two different board layouts of the Seeed Studio CAN BUS FD HAT. The
v1 board doesn't have a battery holder, while the v2 board has. Update the
overlay README accordinly.
