Subject: [PATCH] drm/mipi-dbi: Add driver_private member to struct
 mipi_dbi_dev
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit 1e7e8e1 upstream.

devm_drm_dev_alloc() can't allocate structures that embed a structure
which then again embeds drm_device. Workaround this by adding a
driver_private pointer to struct mipi_dbi_dev which the driver can use for
its additional state.

v3:
- Add documentation
