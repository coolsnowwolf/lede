Subject: [PATCH] usb: xhci: add VLI_TRB_CACHE_BUG quirk

The VL805 fetches up to 4 transfer TRBs at a time. TRB reads don't cross
a 64B boundary, and if a TRB is fetched and is not on a 64B boundary,
the read is sized up to the next 64B boundary.

However the VL805 implements a readahead prefetch for TRBs on a transfer
ring. This fetches the next 64B after any TRB read has happened. Near
the end of a ring segment, the prefetcher can read the first 64B of the
next page in physical memory and this is where the behaviour causes a
bug.

The controller does not tag reads with which endpoint they are for, so
if the start of the next page is a ring segment used by a victim
endpoint, and the victim endpoint is about to fetch TRBs from the start
of the segment, the victim endpoint will read from the prefetched data
and not perform a read to main memory. If the data is stale, the ring
cycle state bit may not be correct and the endpoint will silently halt.

Adjust trbs_per_seg for transfer rings allocated for this controller.
