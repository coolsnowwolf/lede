Subject: [PATCH] dtoverlays: ov9281: Add continuous clock option as an
 override

The previous change to make ov9281 always run in continuous clock
mode causes problems on Pi3 for reasons that aren't fully
understood. Pi4 is quite happy with it.

Change the default back to being non-continuous clock, and add
an override to select continuous clock mode and its slightly
greater max frame rate.
