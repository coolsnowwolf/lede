Subject: [PATCH] spi: Force CS_HIGH if GPIO descriptors are used

Commit f3186dd87669 ("spi: Optionally use GPIO descriptors for CS GPIOs")
amended of_spi_parse_dt() to always set SPI_CS_HIGH for SPI slaves whose
Chip Select is defined by a "cs-gpios" devicetree property.

This change breaks drivers whose probe functions set the mode field of
the spi_device because in doing so they clear the SPI_CS_HIGH flag.

Fix by setting SPI_CS_HIGH in spi_setup (under the same conditions as
in of_spi_parse_dt()).

SQUASH: spi: Demote SPI_CS_HIGH warning to KERN_DEBUG

This warning is unavoidable from a client's perspective and
doesn't indicate anything wrong (just surprising).

SQUASH with "spi: use_gpio_descriptor fixup moved to spi_setup"
