Subject: [PATCH] drm/v3d: Remove `v3d->cpu_job`
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Commit dc4afc0de9654f88676d77094a38f9451d519011 upstream.

CPU jobs, like Cache Clean jobs, execute synchronously once the DRM
scheduler starts running them. Consequently, a global `v3d->cpu_job`
variable is unnecessary, as everything is managed within the
`v3d_cpu_job_run()` function.

This commit removes the `v3d->cpu_job` pointer, as it is not needed.
