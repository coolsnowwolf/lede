Subject: [PATCH] dts: Add noanthogs parameter to CM4 and CM5

By default, the antenna selection on CM4 and CM5 is fixed at boot time,
with the dtparams ant1, ant2 and noant selecting which should be
enabled. Add a new dtparam - noanthogs - which leaves the GPIOs free
to be controlled at runtime by the OS.

N.B. Using this parameter without suitable OS support will leave both
antennae disabled, resulting in attenuated WiFi and Bluetooth signals.
