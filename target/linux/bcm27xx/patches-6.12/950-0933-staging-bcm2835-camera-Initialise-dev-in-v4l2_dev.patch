Subject: [PATCH] staging: bcm2835-camera: Initialise dev in v4l2_dev

Commit 42a2f6664e18 ("staging: vc04_services: Move global g_state to vchiq_state")
changed mmal_init to pass dev->v4l2_dev.dev to vchiq_mmal_init, however
nothing iniitialised dev->v4l2_dev, so we got a NULL pointer dereference.

Set dev->v4l2_dev.dev during bcm2835_mmal_probe. The device pointer
could be passed into v4l2_device_register to set it, however that also
has other effects that would need additional changes.

Fixes: 42a2f6664e18 ("staging: vc04_services: Move global g_state to vchiq_state")
