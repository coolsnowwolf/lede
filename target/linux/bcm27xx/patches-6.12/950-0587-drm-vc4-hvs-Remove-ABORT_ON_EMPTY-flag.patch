Subject: [PATCH] drm/vc4: hvs: Remove ABORT_ON_EMPTY flag

ABORT_ON_EMPTY chooses whether the HVS abandons the current frame
when it experiences an underflow, or attempts to continue.

In theory the frame should be black from the point of underflow,
compared to a shift of sebsequent pixels to the left.

Unfortunately it seems to put the HVS is a bad state where it is not
possible to recover simply. This typically requires a reboot
following the 'flip done timed out message'.

Discussion with Broadcom has suggested we don't use this flag.
All their testing is done with it disabled.

Additionally setting BLANK_INSERT_EN causes the HDMI to output
blank pixels on an underflow which avoids it losing sync.

After this change a 'flip done timed out' due to sdram bandwidth
starvation or too low a clock is recoverable once the situation improves.
