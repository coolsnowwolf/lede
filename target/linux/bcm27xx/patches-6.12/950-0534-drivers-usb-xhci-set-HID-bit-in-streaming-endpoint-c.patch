Subject: [PATCH] drivers: usb: xhci: set HID bit in streaming endpoint
 contexts

The xHC may commence Host Initiated Data Moves for streaming endpoints -
see USB3.2 spec s8.12.1.4.2.4. However, this behaviour is typically
counterproductive as the submission of UAS URBs in {Status, Data,
Command} order and 1 outstanding IO per stream ID means the device never
enters Move Data after a HIMD for Status or Data stages with the same
stream ID. For OUT transfers this is especially inefficient as the host
will start transmitting multiple bulk packets as a burst, all of which
get NAKed by the device - wasting bandwidth.

Also, some buggy UAS adapters don't properly handle the EP flow control
state this creates - e.g. RTL9210.

Set Host Initiated Data Move Disable to always defer stream selection to
the device. xHC implementations may treat this field as "don't care,
forced to 1" anyway - xHCI 1.2 s4.12.1.
