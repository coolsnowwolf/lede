Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: gpu: v3d: Add SMS register to BCM2712 compatible
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

V3D 7.1 exposes a new register block, called V3D_SMS. As BCM2712 has a
V3D 7.1 core, add a new register item to its compatible. Similar to the
GCA, which is specific for V3D 3.3, SMS is optional and should only be
added for V3D 7.1 variants (such as brcm,2712-v3d).
