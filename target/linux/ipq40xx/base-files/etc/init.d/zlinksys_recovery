# This script sets auto_recovery to "yes" and resets the boot counter to 0.
# As a golden rule, this should be the latest script to run at boot. For a
# developer snapshot, it is fine to set auto_recovery here. But for a stable
# release, this script must in fact turn off auto_recovery.
#
# Why? Because the custom sysupgrade script for the device will turn on
# auto_recovery to "yes". And it's the job of this script to set the
# boot boot_count to 0 and then disable auto_recovery, as that condition
# means that the stable release went well.
#
# I have to repeat: this script should be changed for stable releases.
