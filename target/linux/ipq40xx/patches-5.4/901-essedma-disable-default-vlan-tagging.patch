Subject: [PATCH] essedma: disable default vlan tagging

The essedma driver has its own unique take on VLAN management
and its configuration. In the original SDK, each VLAN is
assigned one virtual ethernet netdev.

However, this is non-standard. So, this patch does away
with the default_vlan_tag property the driver is using
and therefore forces the user to use the kernel's vlan
feature.

This patch also removes the "qcom,poll_required = <1>;" from
the essedma node.
