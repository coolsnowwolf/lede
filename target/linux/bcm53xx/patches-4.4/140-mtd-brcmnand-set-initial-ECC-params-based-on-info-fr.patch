Subject: [PATCH] mtd: brcmnand: set initial ECC params based on info from HW
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

So far we were depending on nand_dt_init getting ECC info from DT and
setting it in ECC struct. It is possible to simply read this info from
hardware registers which makes adding support for new hardware way
easier (no more guessing & trying all combinations).
Please note it still gives a precedence to DT which was overwrite
whatever was initially set by the driver.

It took me hours to figure out how to setup NAND on my D-Link DIR-885L.
This should be very helpful for ppl adding new devices support.
