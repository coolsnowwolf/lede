Subject: [PATCH 47/69] mtd: nand: Create a BBT flag to access bad block
 markers in raw mode

Some controllers can access the factory bad block marker from OOB only
when they read it in raw mode. When ECC is enabled, these controllers
discard reading/writing bad block markers, preventing access to them
altogether.

The bbt driver assumes MTD_OPS_PLACE_OOB when scanning for bad blocks.
This results in the nand driver's ecc->read_oob() op to be called, which
works with ECC enabled.

Create a new BBT option flag that tells nand_bbt to force the mode to
MTD_OPS_RAW. This would result in the correct op being called for the
underlying nand controller driver.
