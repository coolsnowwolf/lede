Subject: [PATCH 01/69] dtbindings: qcom_adm: Fix channel specifiers

Original patch from Andy Gross.

This patch removes the crci information from the dma
channel property.  At least one client device requires
using more than one CRCI value for a channel.  This does
not match the current binding and the crci information
needs to be removed.

Instead, the client device will provide this information
via other means.
