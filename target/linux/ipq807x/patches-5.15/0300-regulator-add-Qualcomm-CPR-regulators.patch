+	  This driver supports Core Power Reduction (CPR) version 3 controllers
+	  which are used by some Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. SoCs to
+	  manage important voltage regulators.  CPR3 controllers are capable of
+	  monitoring several ring oscillator sensing loops simultaneously.  The
+	  CPR3 controller informs software when the silicon conditions require
+	  the supply voltage to be increased or decreased.  On certain supply
+	  rails, the CPR3 controller is able to propagate the voltage increase
+	  or decrease requests all the way to the PMIC without software
+	  involvement.
