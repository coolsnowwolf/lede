Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: ipq8074: update APCS node due to clock support

APCS now has support for providing the APSS clocks as the child device
for IPQ8074, so update the DT node to reflect the expanded register space
as well as add #clock-cells property as it now provides the APSS clock
that will be used for CPU scaling.
