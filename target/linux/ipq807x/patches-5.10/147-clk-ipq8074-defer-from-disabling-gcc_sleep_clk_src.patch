Subject: [PATCH] clk: ipq8074: defer from disabling gcc_sleep_clk_src

Added CLK_IS_CRITICAL flag in order to defer from
disabling the sleep clock source.

Once the usb sleep clocks are disabled, clock framework
is trying to disable the sleep clock source also and
the below warning is observed.

[   28.235750] gcc_sleep_clk_src status stuck at 'on'
[   28.235794] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 29 at drivers/clk/qcom/clk-branch.c:92 clk_branch_toggle+0x160/0x178
