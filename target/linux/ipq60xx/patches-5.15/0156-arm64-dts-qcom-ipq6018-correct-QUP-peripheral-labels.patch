Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: ipq6018: correct QUP peripheral labels

Current QUP peripheral labels like spi_0 and i2c_0 dont really tell what is
the exact QUP HW being used as there are actually 6 identical QUP HW blocks
for UART, SPI and I2C.
For example current i2c_0 label actually points to the QUP2 I2C HW.

This style of labeling does not follow what the rest of Qualcomm SoC-s use,
for example IPQ8074 which has the identical QUP blocks.
It also makes it really hard to add the missing QUP DT nodes as there are
multiple missing.

So utilize the same style as other Qualcomm SoC-s are using and update the
CP01 DTS as its the current sole user of them.
