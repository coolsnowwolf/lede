Subject: [PATCH 1006/1011] clk: qcom: ipq6018: openwrt: update parent mapping
 for port clocks

According to our resident expert on Qualcomm IPQ:

  " Ughh, they messed up like they always do, and instead of fixing
    that they just hack it.

    I assume they messed up the parenting as they only set fw_name
    which is locally available, but SSDK is trying to set parenting
    manually without them being available as you need to pass them by
    DT node.

    So, what probably needs to be done instead of hacking it together
    and itself is a workaround for a lack of proper switch driver is
    to also set the .name property so it will still fallback to global
    clock names
  "

To allow the SSDK to set clock parents, also set the ".name" field of
uniphy clocks, as suggested by the expert.
