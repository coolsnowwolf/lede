Subject: [PATCH 20/44] arm64: dts: qcom: Fix ordering of 'clocks' &
 'clock-names' for sdhci nodes

Since the Qualcomm sdhci-msm device-tree binding has been converted
to yaml format, 'make dtbs_check' reports a number of issues with
ordering of 'clocks' & 'clock-names' for sdhci nodes:

 arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/ipq8074-hk10-c2.dtb: sdhci@7824900:
  clock-names:0: 'iface' was expected

 arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/ipq8074-hk10-c2.dtb: sdhci@7824900:
  clock-names:1: 'core' was expected

 arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/ipq8074-hk10-c2.dtb: sdhci@7824900:
  clock-names:2: 'xo' was expected

Fix the same by updating the offending 'dts' files.
