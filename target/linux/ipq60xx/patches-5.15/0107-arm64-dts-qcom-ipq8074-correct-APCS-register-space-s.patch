Subject: [PATCH 107/137] arm64: dts: qcom: ipq8074: correct APCS register
 space size

APCS DTS addition that was merged, was not supposed to get merged as it
was part of patch series that was superseded by 2 more patch series
that resolved issues with this one and greatly simplified things.

Since it already got merged, start by correcting the register space
size as APCS will not be providing regmap for PLL and it will conflict
with the standalone A53 PLL node.

Fixes: 50ed9fffec3a ("arm64: dts: qcom: ipq8074: add APCS node")
