Subject: [PATCH 124/137] arm64: dts: qcom: ipq8074-hk01: add VQMMC supply

Since now we have control over the PMP8074 PMIC providing various system
voltages including L11 which provides the SDIO/eMMC I/O voltage set it as
the SDHCI VQMMC supply.

This allows SDHCI controller to switch to 1.8V I/O mode and support high
speed modes like HS200 and HS400.
