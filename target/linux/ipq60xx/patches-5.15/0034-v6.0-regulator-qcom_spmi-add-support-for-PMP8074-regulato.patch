Subject: [PATCH 34/44] regulator: qcom_spmi: add support for PMP8074
 regulators

PMP8074 is a companion PMIC for the Qualcomm IPQ8074 WiSoC-s.

It features 5 HF-SMPS and 13 LDO regulators.

HF-SMPS regulators are Buck HFS430 regulators.
L1, L2 and L3 are HT_N1200_ST subtype LDO regulators.
L4 is HT_N300_ST subtype LDO regulator.
L5 and L6 are HT_P600 subtype LDO regulators.
L7, L11, L12 and L13 are HT_P150 subtype LDO regulators.
L10 is HT_P50 subtype LDO regulator.

This commit adds support for all of the buck regulators and LDO-s except
for L10 as I dont have documentation on its output voltage range.

S3 is the CPU cluster voltage supply, S4 supplies the UBI32 NPU cores
and L11 is the SDIO/eMMC I/O voltage regulator required for high speeds.
