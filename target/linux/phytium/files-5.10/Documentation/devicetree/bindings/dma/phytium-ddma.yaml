title: Phytium DDMA Controller bindings

description:
  The Phytium DDMA is a general-purpose direct memory access controller capable of
  supporting 8 independent DMA channels. Each channel can have up to 32 requests.
  DMA clients connected to the Phytium DDMA controller must use the format
  described in the dma.txt file, using a two-cell specifier for each
  channel: a phandle to the DMA controller plus the following two integer cells:
    1. The channel id
    2. The request line number
