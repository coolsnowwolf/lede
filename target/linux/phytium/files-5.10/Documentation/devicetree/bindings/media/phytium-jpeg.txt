* Device tree bindings for Phytium JPEG Engine

The JPEG Engine embedded in the Phytium SOCs can capture
and compress video data from digital or analog sources.

Required properties:
 - compatible:		"phytium,jpeg"
 - reg:			 contains the offset and length of the
			 JPEG Engine memory region
 - interrupts:		 the interrupt associated with the VE on this platform
 - phytium,ocm-buf-addr  the physical address used to storage the inputing video data

Example:

jpeg: jpeg@32b32000 {
		compatible = "phytium,jpeg";
		reg = <0x0 0x32b32000 0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 41 4>;
		phytium,ocm-buf-addr = <0x30c40000 0x30c60000>;
		status = "okay";
};
