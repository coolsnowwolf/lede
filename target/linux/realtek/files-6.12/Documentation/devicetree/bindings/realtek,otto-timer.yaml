description: |
  The Realtek SOCs of the RTL83XX and RTL93XX series have at least 5 known
  timers with corresponding interrupt lines . Their speed is derived from the
  Lexra Bus (LXB) by dividers. Each timer has a block of 4 control registers in
  the address range 0xb800xxxx with following start offsets.

  RTL83XX: 0x3100, 0x3110, 0x3120, 0x3130, 0x3140
  RTL93XX: 0x3200, 0x3210, 0x3220, 0x3230, 0x3240
