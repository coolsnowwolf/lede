Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: fsl: ls1028a: Disable eno3 and make swp5 the
 Felix CPU port

This patch returns to the switch port setup from BSP 0.2, where the
switch only had a single Ethernet connection to the CPU, via a tagging
interface. Choose eno2 for this purpose, as it has higher bandwidth and
also supports TSN offloads.

The reason is that the switch is not able to do DSA tags on 2 CPU ports
at the same time, and it is confusing to have so many ports with no
clear indication which should be used for what (a "data" port and a
"control" port).

We don't revert to the BSP 0.2 RCW configuration, however. The ENETC
port 3 is still enabled in the RCW, however it is not probed by Linux by
default, since the large majority of use cases will not need it. For
those that do (like originating 802.1CB traffic from the CPU), it can be
enabled back by simply reverting this device tree change.
