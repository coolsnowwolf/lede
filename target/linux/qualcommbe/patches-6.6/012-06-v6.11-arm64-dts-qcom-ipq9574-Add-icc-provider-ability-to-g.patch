Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: ipq9574: Add icc provider ability to gcc

IPQ SoCs dont involve RPM in managing NoC related clocks and
there is no NoC scaling. Linux itself handles these clocks.
However, these should not be exposed as just clocks and align
with other Qualcomm SoCs that handle these clocks from a
interconnect provider.

Hence include icc provider capability to the gcc node so that
peripherals can use the interconnect facility to enable these
clocks.
