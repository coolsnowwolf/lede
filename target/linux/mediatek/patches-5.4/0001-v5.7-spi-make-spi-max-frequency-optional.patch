Subject: [PATCH 1/2] spi: make spi-max-frequency optional

We only need a spi-max-frequency when we specifically request a
spi frequency lower than the max speed of spi host.
This property is already documented as optional property and current
host drivers are implemented to operate at highest speed possible
when spi->max_speed_hz is 0.
This patch makes spi-max-frequency an optional property so that
we could just omit it to use max controller speed.
