Subject: [PATCH] leds: turris-omnia: support HW controlled mode via
 private trigger
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Add support for enabling MCU controlled mode of the Turris Omnia LEDs
via a LED private trigger called "omnia-mcu".

When in MCU controlled mode, the user can still set LED color, but the
blinking is done by MCU, which does different things for various LEDs:
- WAN LED is blinked according to the LED[0] pin of the WAN PHY
- LAN LEDs are blinked according to the LED[0] output of corresponding
  port of the LAN switch
- PCIe LEDs are blinked according to the logical OR of the MiniPCIe port
  LED pins

For a long time I wanted to actually do this differently: I wanted to
make the netdev trigger to transparently offload the blinking to the HW
if user set compatible settings for the netdev trigger.
There was some work on this, and hopefully we will be able to complete
it sometime, but since there are various complications, it will probably
not be soon.

In the meantime let's support HW controlled mode via this private LED
trigger. If, in the future, we manage to complete the netdev trigger
offloading, we can still keep this private trigger for backwards
compatiblity, if needed.

We also set "omnia-mcu" to cdev->default_trigger, so that the MCU keeps
control until the user first wants to take over it. If a different
default trigger is specified in device-tree via the
`linux,default-trigger` property, LED class will overwrite
cdev->default_trigger, and so the DT property will be respected.
