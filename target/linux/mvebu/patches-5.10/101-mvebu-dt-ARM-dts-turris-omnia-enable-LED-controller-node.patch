Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: turris-omnia: enable LED controller node
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The LED controller node is disabled because the leds-turris-omnia driver
does not support setting the LED blinking to be controlled by the MCU.

The patches for that have now been sent [1], so let's enable the node.
