Subject: [PATCH] net: mvneta: Fix spinlock usage

In the previous patch, the spinlock was not initialized. While it didn't
cause any trouble yet it could be a problem to use it uninitialized.

The most annoying part was the critical section protected by the spinlock
in mvneta_stop(). Some of the functions could sleep as pointed when
activated CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP. Actually, in mvneta_stop() we only
need to protect the is_stopped flagged, indeed the code of the notifier
for CPU online is protected by the same spinlock, so when we get the
lock, the notifer work is done.
