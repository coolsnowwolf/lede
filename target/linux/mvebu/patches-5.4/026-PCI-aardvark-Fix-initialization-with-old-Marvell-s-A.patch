Subject: [PATCH] PCI: aardvark: Fix initialization with old Marvell's Arm
 Trusted Firmware
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Old ATF automatically power on pcie phy and does not provide SMC call for
phy power on functionality which leads to aardvark initialization failure:

[    0.330134] mvebu-a3700-comphy d0018300.phy: unsupported SMC call, try updating your firmware
[    0.338846] phy phy-d0018300.phy.1: phy poweron failed --> -95
[    0.344753] advk-pcie d0070000.pcie: Failed to initialize PHY (-95)
[    0.351160] advk-pcie: probe of d0070000.pcie failed with error -95

This patch fixes above failure by ignoring 'not supported' error in
aardvark driver. In this case it is expected that phy is already power on.
