Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: armada-3720-espressobin: correct spi node

The manufacturer of this board, ships it with various SPI NOR chips and
increments U-Boot bootloader version along the time. There is no way to
tell which is placed on the board since no revision bump takes place.
This creates two issues.

The first, cosmetic. Since the SPI chip may differ, there's message on
boot stating that kernel expected w25q32dw and found different one. To
correct this, remove optional device-specific compatible string. Being
here lets replace bogus "spi-flash" string with proper one.

The second is linked to partitions layout, it changed after commit [1]
in Marvells downstream U-Boot fork, shifting environment location to the
end of boot device. Since the new boards can have U-Boot with this
change it can lead to improper results writing or reading from these
partitions. We can't tell if users will update bootloader to recent
version, so let's drop current layout.
