Subject: [PATCH] mtd: spi-nor: Add support for BoHong bh25q128as

Add MTD support for the BoHong bh25q128as SPI NOR chip.
The chip has 16MB of total capacity, divided into a total of 256
sectors, each 64KB sized. The chip also supports 4KB sectors.
Additionally, it supports dual and quad read modes.

Functionality was verified on an Tenbay WR1800K / MTK MT7621 board.
