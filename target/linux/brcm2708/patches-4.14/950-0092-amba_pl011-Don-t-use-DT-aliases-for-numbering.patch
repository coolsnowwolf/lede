Subject: [PATCH 092/454] amba_pl011: Don't use DT aliases for numbering

The pl011 driver looks for DT aliases of the form "serial<n>",
and if found uses <n> as the device ID. This can cause
/dev/ttyAMA0 to become /dev/ttyAMA1, which is confusing if the
other serial port is provided by the 8250 driver which doesn't
use the same logic.
