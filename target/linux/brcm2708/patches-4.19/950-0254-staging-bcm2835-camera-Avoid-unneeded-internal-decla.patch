Subject: [PATCH 254/806] staging: bcm2835-camera: Avoid unneeded internal
 declaration warning

Clang warns:

drivers/staging/vc04_services/bcm2835-camera/controls.c:59:18: warning:
variable 'mains_freq_qmenu' is not needed and will not be emitted
[-Wunneeded-internal-declaration]
static const s64 mains_freq_qmenu[] = {
                 ^
1 warning generated.

This is because mains_freq_qmenu is currently only used in an ARRAY_SIZE
macro, which is a compile time evaluation in this case. Avoid this by
adding mains_freq_qmenu as the imenu member of this structure, which
matches all other controls that uses the ARRAY_SIZE macro in v4l2_ctrls.
This turns out to be a no-op because V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_BITRATE_MODE is
defined as a MMAL_CONTROL_TYPE_STD_MENU, which does not pass the imenu
definition along to v4l2_ctrl_new in bm2835_mmal_init_controls.
