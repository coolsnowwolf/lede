Subject: [PATCH 521/806] ARM: bcm283x: Extend the WDT DT node out to cover the
 whole PM block. (v4)

It was covering part of the PM block's range, up to the WDT regs.  To
support the rest of the PM block's functionality, we need the full
register range plus the AXI Async Bridge regs for PM sequencing.

This doesn't convert any of the consumers over to the new binding yet,
since we will need to be careful in coordinating our usage of firmware
services that might power domains on and off versus the bcm2835-pm
driver's access of those same domains.
