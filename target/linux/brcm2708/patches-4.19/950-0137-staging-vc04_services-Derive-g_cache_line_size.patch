Subject: [PATCH 137/806] staging/vc04_services: Derive g_cache_line_size

The ARM coprocessor registers include dcache line size, but there is no
function to expose this value. Rather than create a new one, use the
read_cpuid_id function to derive the correct value, which is 32 for
BCM2835 and 64 for BCM2836/7.
