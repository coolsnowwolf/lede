Subject: [PATCH] dwc_otg: constrain endpoint max packet and transfer
 size on split IN

The hcd would unconditionally set the transfer length to the endpoint
packet size for non-isoc IN transfers. If the remaining buffer length
was less than the length of returned data, random memory would get
scribbled over, with bad effects if it crossed a page boundary.

Force a babble error if this happens by limiting the max transfer size
to the available buffer space. DMA will stop writing to memory on a
babble condition.

The hardware expects xfersize to be an integer multiple of maxpacket
size, so override hcchar.b.mps as well.
