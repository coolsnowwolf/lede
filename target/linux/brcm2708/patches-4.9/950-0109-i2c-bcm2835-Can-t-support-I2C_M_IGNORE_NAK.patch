Subject: [PATCH] i2c: bcm2835: Can't support I2C_M_IGNORE_NAK
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The controller can't support this flag, so remove it.

Documentation/i2c/i2c-protocol states that all of the message is sent:

I2C_M_IGNORE_NAK:
    Normally message is interrupted immediately if there is [NA] from the
    client. Setting this flag treats any [NA] as [A], and all of
    message is sent.

From the BCM2835 ARM Peripherals datasheet:

    The ERR field is set when the slave fails to acknowledge either
    its address or a data byte written to it.

So when the controller doesn't receive an ack, it sets ERR and raises
an interrupt. In other words, the whole message is not sent.
