Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: phy: Add special clock for Allwinner H616 PHY

The USB PHY IP in the Allwinner H616 SoC requires a quirk that involves
some resources from port 2's PHY and HCI IP. In particular the PMU clock
for port 2 must be surely ungated before accessing the REG_HCI_PHY_CTL
register of port 2. To allow each USB port to be controlled
independently of port 2, we need a handle to that particular PMU clock
in the *PHY* node, as the HCI and PHY part might be handled by separate
drivers.

Add that clock to the requirements of the H616 PHY binding, so that a
PHY driver can apply the quirk in isolation, without requiring help from
port 2's HCI driver.
