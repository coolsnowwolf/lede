Subject: [PATCH] thermal/drivers/sun8i: Don't fail probe due to zone
 registration failure

Currently the sun8i thermal driver will fail to probe if any of the
thermal zones it is registering fails to register with the thermal core.
Since we currently do not define any trip points for the GPU thermal
zones on at least A64 or H5 this means that we have no thermal support
on these platforms:

[    1.698703] thermal_sys: Failed to find 'trips' node
[    1.698707] thermal_sys: Failed to find trip points for thermal-sensor id=1

even though the main CPU thermal zone on both SoCs is fully configured.
This does not seem ideal, while we may not be able to use all the zones
it seems better to have those zones which are usable be operational.
Instead just carry on registering zones if we get any non-deferral
error, allowing use of those zones which are usable.

This means that we also need to update the interrupt handler to not
attempt to notify the core for events on zones which we have not
registered, I didn't see an ability to mask individual interrupts and
I would expect that interrupts would still be indicated in the ISR even
if they were masked.
