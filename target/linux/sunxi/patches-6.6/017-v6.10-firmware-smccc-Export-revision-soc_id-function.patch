Subject: [PATCH] firmware: smccc: Export revision soc_id function

The "SoC ID revision" as provided via the SMCCC SOCID interface can be
valuable information for drivers, when certain functionality depends
on a die revision, for instance.
One example is the sun50i-cpufreq-nvmem driver, which needs this
information to determine the speed bin of the SoC.

Export the arm_smccc_get_soc_id_revision() function so that it can be
called by any driver.
