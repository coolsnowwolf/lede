Subject: [PATCH] printk: always setup default (tty0 + stdout / SPCR) consoles
 when no console= present

(This is a hack specific to OpenWrt's armsr target)

This change resolves a difference in behaviour between arm64 ACPI
and DT systems.
Our usecase is to ensure the system console is always present
regardless of display mode (serial port or screen).

Both ACPI and DT have mechanisms to setup a serial console from
information passed by firmware (SPCR and stdout-path respectively).

On ACPI systems, the SPCR table is parsed very early on in the kernel
boot which prevents the screen console (tty0) from appearing if it is
not explicitly set.

We would like to avoid specifying console= arguments as there are many
possible configurations on the serial side (like ttyS0, ttyAMA0, ttymxc0
etc.).

If the kernel does not consume the serial port in SPCR/stdout-path,
then the 'default' settings from the firmware (baud rate etc.) are lost.

If the system administrator explicitly specifies a console= argument,
then the old behaviour is returned.
