Subject: [PATCH] mmc: dw_mmc: Support setting f_min from host drivers

Host drivers may not be able to support frequencies as low as dw-mmc
supports. Unfortunately f_min isn't available when the drv_data->init
function is called, as the mmc_host struct hasn't been set up yet.

Support the host drivers saving the requested minimum frequency, so we
can later set f_min when it is available.
