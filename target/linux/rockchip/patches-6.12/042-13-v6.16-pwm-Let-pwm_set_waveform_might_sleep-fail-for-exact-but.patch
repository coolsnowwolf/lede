Subject: [PATCH] pwm: Let pwm_set_waveform_might_sleep() fail for exact but
 impossible requests
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Up to now pwm_set_waveform_might_sleep() returned 1 for exact requests
that couldn't be served exactly. In contrast to
pwm_round_waveform_might_sleep() and pwm_set_waveform_might_sleep() with
exact = false this is an error condition. So simplify handling for
callers of pwm_set_waveform_might_sleep() by returning -EDOM instead of
1 in this case.
