Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: rk356x: Add MSI controller node

Rockchip 356x SoC's GIC has two hardware integration issues that
affect MSI functionality of the GIC. Previously, both these GIC
issues were worked around by using MBI for MSI instead of ITS
because kernel GIC driver didn't have necessary quirks.

First issue is about RK356x GIC not supporting programmable
shareability, while reporting it as supported in a GIC's feature
register. Rockchip assigned Erratum ID #3568001 for this issue. This
patch adds dma-noncoherent property to the GIC node, denoting that a SW
workaround is required for mitigating the issue.

Second issue is about GIC AXI master interface addressing limited to
the first 4GB of physical address space. Rockchip assigned Erratum
ID #3568002 for this issue.

Now that kernel supports quirks for both of the erratums, add
MSI controller node to RK356x device-tree.
