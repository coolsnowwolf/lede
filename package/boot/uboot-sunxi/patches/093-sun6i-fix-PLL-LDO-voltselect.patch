Subject: sun6i: Fix and document PLL LDO voltage selection

The PRCM_PLL_CTRL_LDO_OUT_L and PRCM_PLL_CTRL_LDO_OUT_H macros had
their meaning reversed. This is fixed by this change-set. With this
changed, the PRCM_PLL_CTRL_LDO_OUT_L(1370) now becomes self-evident
as setting the voltage to 1.37v (which it had done all along, even
though stating a different target voltage).

After changing the PLL LDO setting, it will take a little while for
the voltage output to settle. A sdelay()-based loop waits the same
order of magnitude as Boot1.

Furthermore, a bit of documentation is added to clarify that the
required setting for the PLL LDO is 1.37v as per the A31 manual.
