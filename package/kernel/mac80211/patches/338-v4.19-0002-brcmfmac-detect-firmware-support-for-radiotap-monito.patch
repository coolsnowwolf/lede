Subject: [PATCH] brcmfmac: detect firmware support for radiotap monitor frames
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Depending on used build-time options some firmwares may already include
radiotap header in passed monitor frames. Add a new feature flag to
store info about it. It's needed for proper handling of received frames
before passing them up.
