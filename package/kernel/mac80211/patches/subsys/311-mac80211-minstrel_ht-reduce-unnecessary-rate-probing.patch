Subject: [PATCH] mac80211: minstrel_ht: reduce unnecessary rate probing
 attempts

On hardware with static fallback tables (e.g. mt76x2), rate probing attempts
can be very expensive.
On such devices, avoid sampling rates slower than the per-group max throughput
rate, based on the assumption that the fallback table will take care of probing
lower rates within that group if the higher rates fail.
To make this work, this also fixes a wrong initialization in the previously
unused per-group sorted rate array.
To further reduce unnecessary probing attempts, skip duplicate attempts on
rates slower than the max throughput rate.
