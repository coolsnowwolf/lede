Subject: [PATCH] mac80211: always use mac80211 loss detection

ath10k does not report excessive loss in case of broken block-ack
sessions. The loss is communicated to the host-os, but ath10k does not
trigger a low-ack events by itself.

The mac80211 framework for loss detection however detects this
circumstance well in case of ath10k. So use it regardless of ath10k's
own loss detection mechanism.

Patching this in mac80211 does allow this hack to be used with any
flavor of ath10k/ath11k.
