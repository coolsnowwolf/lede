Subject: [PATCH] brcmfmac: support firmware reporting 160 MHz channels
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

So far 160 MHz channels were treated as 20 MHz ones which was breaking
support for 40/80 MHz due to the brcmf_construct_chaninfo() logic and
its assumptions.
