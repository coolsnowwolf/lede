Subject: [PATCH] ath10k: Don't initialize devices asynchronously

OpenWrt requires all PHYs to be initialized to create the configuration files
during bootup. ath10k violates this because it delays the creation of the PHY
to a not well defined point in the future.

Forcing the work to be done immediately works around this problem but may also
delay the boot when firmware images cannot be found.
