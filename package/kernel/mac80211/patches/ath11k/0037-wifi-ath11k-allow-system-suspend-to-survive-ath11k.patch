Subject: [PATCH] wifi: ath11k: allow system suspend to survive ath11k

When ath11k runs into internal errors upon suspend,
it returns an error code to pci_pm_suspend, which
aborts the entire system suspend.

The driver should not abort system suspend, but should
keep its internal errors to itself, and allow the system
to suspend.  Otherwise, a user can suspend a laptop
by closing the lid and sealing it into a case, assuming
that is will suspend, rather than heating up and draining
the battery when in transit.

In practice, the ath11k device seems to have plenty of transient
errors, and subsequent suspend cycles after this failure
often succeed.
