Release Notes

[V1.3.4]
Date:   12/8/2022
enhancement:
  1. only allow to enable autosuspend when module is in MHI_EE_AMSS
  2. show pcie link speed and width when driver probe
  3. check pcie link status by read pcie vid and pid when driver probe,
     if pcie link is down, return -EIO
  4. support RM520 (1eac:1004)
  5. support qmap command packet
fix:
  1. fix tx queue is wrong stop when do uplink TPUT
  2. fix after QFirehose, module fail to bootup at very small probability
  3. mhi uci add mutex lock for concurrent reads/writes

[V1.3.3]
Date:   30/6/2022
enhancement:
  1. remove one un-necessary kmalloc when do qfirehose
  2. support mhi monitor (like usbmon), usage: cat /sys/kernel/debug/mhi_q/0306_00\:01.00/mhimon
  3. set ring size of event 0 to 256 (from 1024), required by x6x
  4. support PCIE local network card mhi_swip0 (chan 46/47), default disabled
  5. porting IPQ5018 mhi rate controll code from spf11.5 
  6. set pcie rmnet download max qmap packet size to 15KB (same to IPQ MHI Driver)
  7. support set different mac address for rmnet net card
  8. when mhi netdev fail to malloc, use delay_work instead work
  9. optimize code for 'when driver load, modem is still in MHI_EE_PTHRU' 
fix:
 1. Fix not synchronize access rp/wp when mhi_queue_xxx and mhi_process_xxx_ring run on different CPU
 2. set dma mask when driver probe, some SOC like rpi_4 need it
