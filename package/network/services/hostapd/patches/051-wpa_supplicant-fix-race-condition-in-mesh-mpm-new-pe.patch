Subject: [PATCH v2] wpa_supplicant: fix race condition in mesh mpm new peer
 handling

When wpa_supplicant receives another new peer event before the first one
has been processed, it tries to add a station to the driver a second time
(which fails) and then tears down the station entry until another event
comes in.
Fix this by only adding a station to the driver if it didn't exist already.
