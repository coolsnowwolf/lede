Subject: [PATCH 2/7] mesh: update ssid->frequency as pri/sec channel switch

ssid->frequency is one of variables used to gets channel
number from given frequency. Leave it as unchanged when
pri/sec channel switched will cause picking up wrong
channel number after applying secondary channel offset
for HT40 and leads failing interface bring-up.
