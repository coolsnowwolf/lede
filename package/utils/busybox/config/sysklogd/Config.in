config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_KLOGD
	bool "klogd (5.7 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_KLOGD
	help
	klogd is a utility which intercepts and logs all
	messages from the Linux kernel and sends the messages
	out to the 'syslogd' utility so they can be logged. If
	you wish to record the messages produced by the kernel,
	you should enable this option.

comment "klogd should not be used together with syslog to kernel printk buffer"
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_KLOGD && BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_KMSG_SYSLOG

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_KLOGD_KLOGCTL
	bool "Use the klogctl() interface"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_KLOGD_KLOGCTL
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_KLOGD
	help
	The klogd applet supports two interfaces for reading
	kernel messages. Linux provides the klogctl() interface
	which allows reading messages from the kernel ring buffer
	independently from the file system.

	If you answer 'N' here, klogd will use the more portable
	approach of reading them from /proc or a device node.
	However, this method requires the file to be available.

	If in doubt, say 'Y'.
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LOGGER
	bool "logger (6.3 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_LOGGER
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SYSLOG
	help
	The logger utility allows you to send arbitrary text
	messages to the system log (i.e. the 'syslogd' utility) so
	they can be logged. This is generally used to help locate
	problems that occur within programs and scripts.
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LOGREAD
	bool "logread (4.8 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_LOGREAD
	help
	If you enabled Circular Buffer support, you almost
	certainly want to enable this feature as well. This
	utility will allow you to read the messages that are
	stored in the syslogd circular buffer.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_LOGREAD_REDUCED_LOCKING
	bool "Double buffering"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_LOGREAD_REDUCED_LOCKING
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LOGREAD
	help
	'logread' output to slow serial terminals can have
	side effects on syslog because of the semaphore.
	This option make logread to double buffer copy
	from circular buffer, minimizing semaphore
	contention at some minor memory expense.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SYSLOGD
	bool "syslogd (13 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_SYSLOGD
	help
	The syslogd utility is used to record logs of all the
	significant events that occur on a system. Every
	message that is logged records the date and time of the
	event, and will generally also record the name of the
	application that generated the message. When used in
	conjunction with klogd, messages from the Linux kernel
	can also be recorded. This is terribly useful,
	especially for finding what happened when something goes
	wrong. And something almost always will go wrong if
	you wait long enough....

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_ROTATE_LOGFILE
	bool "Rotate message files"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_ROTATE_LOGFILE
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SYSLOGD
	help
	This enables syslogd to rotate the message files
	on his own. No need to use an external rotate script.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_REMOTE_LOG
	bool "Remote Log support"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_REMOTE_LOG
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SYSLOGD
	help
	When you enable this feature, the syslogd utility can
	be used to send system log messages to another system
	connected via a network. This allows the remote
	machine to log all the system messages, which can be
	terribly useful for reducing the number of serial
	cables you use. It can also be a very good security
	measure to prevent system logs from being tampered with
	by an intruder.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SYSLOGD_DUP
	bool "Support -D (drop dups) option"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_SYSLOGD_DUP
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SYSLOGD
	help
	Option -D instructs syslogd to drop consecutive messages
	which are totally the same.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SYSLOGD_CFG
	bool "Support syslog.conf"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_SYSLOGD_CFG
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SYSLOGD
	help
	Supports restricted syslogd config. See docs/syslog.conf.txt

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SYSLOGD_PRECISE_TIMESTAMPS
	bool "Include milliseconds in timestamps"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_SYSLOGD_PRECISE_TIMESTAMPS
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SYSLOGD
	help
	Includes milliseconds (HH:MM:SS.mmm) in timestamp when
	timestamps are added.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SYSLOGD_READ_BUFFER_SIZE
	int "Read buffer size in bytes"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_SYSLOGD_READ_BUFFER_SIZE
	range 256 20000
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SYSLOGD
	help
	This option sets the size of the syslog read buffer.
	Actual memory usage increases around five times the
	change done here.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_IPC_SYSLOG
	bool "Circular Buffer support"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_IPC_SYSLOG
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SYSLOGD
	help
	When you enable this feature, the syslogd utility will
	use a circular buffer to record system log messages.
	When the buffer is filled it will continue to overwrite
	the oldest messages. This can be very useful for
	systems with little or no permanent storage, since
	otherwise system logs can eventually fill up your
	entire filesystem, which may cause your system to
	break badly.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_IPC_SYSLOG_BUFFER_SIZE
	int "Circular buffer size in Kbytes (minimum 4KB)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_IPC_SYSLOG_BUFFER_SIZE
	range 4 2147483647
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_IPC_SYSLOG
	help
	This option sets the size of the circular buffer
	used to record system log messages.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_KMSG_SYSLOG
	bool "Linux kernel printk buffer support"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_KMSG_SYSLOG
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SYSLOGD
	help
	When you enable this feature, the syslogd utility will
	write system log message to the Linux kernel's printk buffer.
	This can be used as a smaller alternative to the syslogd IPC
	support, as klogd and logread aren't needed.

	NOTICE: Syslog facilities in log entries needs kernel 3.5+.
