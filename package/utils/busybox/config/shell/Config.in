config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH
	bool "ash"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_ASH
	depends on !BUSYBOX_CONFIG_NOMMU
	help
	  Tha 'ash' shell adds about 60k in the default configuration and is
	  the most complete and most pedantically correct shell included with
	  busybox. This shell is actually a derivative of the Debian 'dash'
	  shell (by Herbert Xu), which was created by porting the 'ash' shell
	  (written by Kenneth Almquist) from NetBSD.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH_BASH_COMPAT
	bool "bash-compatible extensions"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_ASH_BASH_COMPAT

	help
	  Enable bash-compatible extensions.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH_IDLE_TIMEOUT
	bool "Idle timeout variable"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_ASH_IDLE_TIMEOUT
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH
	help
	  Enables bash-like auto-logout after $TMOUT seconds of idle time.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH_JOB_CONTROL
	bool "Job control"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_ASH_JOB_CONTROL

	bool "Builtin version of 'echo'"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_ASH_BUILTIN_ECHO
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH
	help
	  Enable support for echo builtin in ash.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH_BUILTIN_PRINTF

	bool "'command' command to override shell builtins"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_ASH_CMDCMD
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH
	help
	  Enable support for the ash 'command' builtin, which allows
	  you to run the specified command with the specified arguments,
	  even when there is an ash builtin command with the same name.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH_MAIL
	bool "Check for new mail on interactive shells"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_ASH_MAIL
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH
	help
	  Enable "check for new mail" function in the ash shell.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE
	bool "Optimize for size instead of speed"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_ASH_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH
	help
	  Compile ash for reduced size at the price of speed.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH_RANDOM_SUPPORT
	bool "Pseudorandom generator and $RANDOM variable"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_ASH_RANDOM_SUPPORT
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH
	help
	  Enable pseudorandom generator and dynamic variable "$RANDOM".
	  Each read of "$RANDOM" will generate a new pseudorandom value.
	  You can reset the generator by using a specified start value.
	  After "unset RANDOM" the generator will switch off and this
	  variable will no longer have special treatment.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH_EXPAND_PRMT
	bool "Expand prompt string"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_ASH_EXPAND_PRMT
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH
	help
	  "PS#" may contain volatile content, such as backquote commands.
	  This option recreates the prompt string from the environment
	  variable each time it is displayed.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_CTTYHACK
	bool "cttyhack"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_CTTYHACK
	help
	  One common problem reported on the mailing list is the "can't
	  access tty; job control turned off" error message, which typically
	  appears when one tries to use a shell with stdin/stdout on
	  /dev/console.
	  This device is special - it cannot be a controlling tty.

	  The proper solution is to use the correct device instead of
	  /dev/console.

	  cttyhack provides a "quick and dirty" solution to this problem.
	  It analyzes stdin with various ioctls, trying to determine whether
	  it is a /dev/ttyN or /dev/ttySN (virtual terminal or serial line).
	  On Linux it also checks sysfs for a pointer to the active console.
	  If cttyhack is able to find the real console device, it closes
	  stdin/out/err and reopens that device.
	  Then it executes the given program. Opening the device will make
	  that device a controlling tty. This may require cttyhack
	  to be a session leader.

	  Example for /etc/inittab (for busybox init):

	  ::respawn:/bin/cttyhack /bin/sh

	  Starting an interactive shell from boot shell script:

	  setsid cttyhack sh

	  Giving controlling tty to shell running with PID 1:

	  # exec cttyhack sh

	  Without cttyhack, you need to know exact tty name,
	  and do something like this:

	  # exec setsid sh -c 'exec sh </dev/tty1 >/dev/tty1 2>&1'

	  Starting getty on a controlling tty from a shell script:

	  # getty 115200 $(cttyhack)
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH
	bool "hush"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_HUSH
	help
	  hush is a small shell (25k). It handles the normal flow control
	  constructs such as if/then/elif/else/fi, for/in/do/done, while loops,
	  case/esac. Redirections, here documents, $((arithmetic))
	  and functions are supported.

	  It will compile and work on no-mmu systems.

	  It does not handle select, aliases, tilde expansion,
	  &>file and >&file redirection of stdout+stderr.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH_BASH_COMPAT
	bool "bash-compatible extensions"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_HUSH_BASH_COMPAT

	  Enable bash-compatible extensions.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH_BRACE_EXPANSION
	bool "Brace expansion"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_HUSH_BRACE_EXPANSION

	  Enable {abc,def} extension.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH_HELP
	bool "help builtin"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_HUSH_HELP
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH
	help
	  Enable help builtin in hush. Code size + ~1 kbyte.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH_INTERACTIVE
	bool "Interactive mode"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_HUSH_INTERACTIVE
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH
	help
	  Enable interactive mode (prompt and command editing).
	  Without this, hush simply reads and executes commands
	  from stdin just like a shell script from a file.
	  No prompt, no PS1/PS2 magic shell variables.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH_SAVEHISTORY
	bool "Save command history to .hush_history"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_HUSH_SAVEHISTORY
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH_INTERACTIVE && BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_EDITING_SAVEHISTORY
	help
	  Enable history saving in hush.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH_JOB
	bool "Job control"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_HUSH_JOB
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH_INTERACTIVE
	help
	  Enable job control: Ctrl-Z backgrounds, Ctrl-C interrupts current
	  command (not entire shell), fg/bg builtins work. Without this option,
	  "cmd &" still works by simply spawning a process and immediately
	  prompting for next command (or executing next command in a script),
	  but no separate process group is formed.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH_TICK
	bool "Process substitution"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_HUSH_TICK
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH
	help
	  Enable process substitution `command` and $(command) in hush.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH_CASE
	bool "Support case ... esac statement"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_HUSH_CASE
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH
	help
	  Enable case ... esac statement in hush. +400 bytes.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH_FUNCTIONS
	bool "Support funcname() { commands; } syntax"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_HUSH_FUNCTIONS
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH

	bool "Support local builtin"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_HUSH_LOCAL
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH_FUNCTIONS
	help
	  Enable support for local variables in functions.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH_RANDOM_SUPPORT
	bool "Pseudorandom generator and $RANDOM variable"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_HUSH_RANDOM_SUPPORT
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH
	help
	  Enable pseudorandom generator and dynamic variable "$RANDOM".
	  Each read of "$RANDOM" will generate a new pseudorandom value.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH_EXPORT_N
	bool "Support 'export -n' option"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_HUSH_EXPORT_N
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH
	help
	  export -n unexports variables. It is a bash extension.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH_MODE_X
	bool "Support 'hush -x' option and 'set -x' command"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_HUSH_MODE_X
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH
	help
	  This instructs hush to print commands before execution.
	  Adds ~300 bytes.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_MSH
	bool "msh (deprecated: aliased to hush)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_MSH
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH
	help
	  msh is deprecated and will be removed, please migrate to hush.

choice
	prompt "Choose which shell is aliased to 'bash' name"
	default BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_BASH_IS_NONE
	help
	  Choose which shell you want to be executed by 'bash' alias.
	  The ash shell is the most bash compatible and full featured one.

	  Note that selecting this option does not switch on any bash
	  compatibility code. It merely makes it possible to install
	  /bin/bash (sym)link and run scripts which start with
	  #!/bin/bash line.

	  Many systems use it in scripts which use bash-specific features,
	  even simple ones like $RANDOM. Without this option, busybox
	  can't be used for running them because it won't recongnize
	  "bash" as a supported applet name.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SH_MATH_SUPPORT
	bool "POSIX math support"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_SH_MATH_SUPPORT
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH
	help
	  Enable math support in the shell via $((...)) syntax.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SH_MATH_SUPPORT_64
	bool "Extend POSIX math support to 64 bit"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_SH_MATH_SUPPORT_64
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SH_MATH_SUPPORT
	help
	  Enable 64-bit math support in the shell. This will make the shell
	  slightly larger, but will allow computation with very large numbers.
	  This is not in POSIX, so do not rely on this in portable code.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SH_EXTRA_QUIET
	bool "Hide message on interactive shell startup"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_SH_EXTRA_QUIET
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH
	help
	  Remove the busybox introduction when starting a shell.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SH_STANDALONE
	bool "Standalone shell"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_SH_STANDALONE
	depends on (BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH) && BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_PREFER_APPLETS
	help
	  This option causes busybox shells to use busybox applets
	  in preference to executables in the PATH whenever possible. For
	  example, entering the command 'ifconfig' into the shell would cause
	  busybox to use the ifconfig busybox applet. Specifying the fully
	  qualified executable name, such as '/sbin/ifconfig' will still
	  execute the /sbin/ifconfig executable on the filesystem. This option
	  is generally used when creating a statically linked version of busybox
	  for use as a rescue shell, in the event that you screw up your system.

	  This is implemented by re-execing /proc/self/exe (typically)
	  with right parameters. Some selected applets ("NOFORK" applets)
	  can even be executed without creating new process.
	  Instead, busybox will call <applet>_main() internally.

	  However, this causes problems in chroot jails without mounted /proc
	  and with ps/top (command name can be shown as 'exe' for applets
	  started this way).
# untrue?
#	  Note that this will *also* cause applets to take precedence
#	  over shell builtins of the same name. So turning this on will
#	  eliminate any performance gained by turning on the builtin "echo"
#	  and "test" commands in ash.
# untrue?
#	  Note that when using this option, the shell will attempt to directly
#	  run '/bin/busybox'. If you do not have the busybox binary sitting in
#	  that exact location with that exact name, this option will not work at
#	  all.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SH_NOFORK
	bool "Run 'nofork' applets directly"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_SH_NOFORK
	depends on (BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH) && BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_PREFER_APPLETS
	help
	  This option causes busybox shells to not execute typical
	  fork/exec/wait sequence, but call <applet>_main directly,
	  if possible. (Sometimes it is not possible: for example,
	  this is not possible in pipes).

	  This will be done only for some applets (those which are marked
	  NOFORK in include/applets.h).

	  This may significantly speed up some shell scripts.

	  This feature is relatively new. Use with care. Report bugs
	  to project mailing list.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SH_HISTFILESIZE
	bool "Use $HISTFILESIZE"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_SH_HISTFILESIZE
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HUSH || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ASH
	help
	  This option makes busybox shells to use $HISTFILESIZE variable
	  to set shell history size. Note that its max value is capped
	  by "History size" setting in library tuning section.
