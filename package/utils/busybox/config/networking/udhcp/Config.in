config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPD
	bool "udhcpd (21 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_UDHCPD
	help
	udhcpd is a DHCP server geared primarily toward embedded systems,
	while striving to be fully functional and RFC compliant.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_UDHCPD_BASE_IP_ON_MAC
	bool "Select IP address based on client MAC"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_UDHCPD_BASE_IP_ON_MAC
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPD
	help
	If selected, udhcpd will base its selection of IP address to offer
	on the client's hardware address. Otherwise udhcpd uses the next
	consecutive free address.

	This reduces the frequency of IP address changes for clients
	which let their lease expire, and makes consecutive DHCPOFFERS
	for the same client to (almost always) contain the same
	IP address.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_UDHCPD_WRITE_LEASES_EARLY
	bool "Rewrite lease file at every new acknowledge"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_UDHCPD_WRITE_LEASES_EARLY
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPD
	help
	If selected, udhcpd will write a new file with leases every
	time a new lease has been accepted, thus eliminating the need
	to send SIGUSR1 for the initial writing or updating. Any timed
	rewriting remains undisturbed.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_DHCPD_LEASES_FILE
	string "Absolute path to lease file"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_DHCPD_LEASES_FILE
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPD
	help
	udhcpd stores addresses in a lease file. This is the absolute path
	of the file. Normally it is safe to leave it untouched.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_DUMPLEASES
	bool "dumpleases (5.1 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_DUMPLEASES
	help
	dumpleases displays the leases written out by the udhcpd.
	Lease times are stored in the file by time remaining in lease, or
	by the absolute time that it expires in seconds from epoch.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_DHCPRELAY
	bool "dhcprelay (5.2 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_DHCPRELAY
	help
	dhcprelay listens for DHCP requests on one or more interfaces
	and forwards these requests to a different interface or DHCP
	server.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPC
	bool "udhcpc (24 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_UDHCPC
	help
	udhcpc is a DHCP client geared primarily toward embedded systems,
	while striving to be fully functional and RFC compliant.

	The udhcp client negotiates a lease with the DHCP server and
	runs a script when a lease is obtained or lost.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_UDHCPC_ARPING
	bool "Verify that the offered address is free, using ARP ping"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_UDHCPC_ARPING
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPC
	help
	If selected, udhcpc will send ARP probes and make sure
	the offered address is really not in use by anyone. The client
	will DHCPDECLINE the offer if the address is in use,
	and restart the discover process.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_UDHCPC_SANITIZEOPT
	bool "Do not pass malformed host and domain names"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_UDHCPC_SANITIZEOPT
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPC
	help
	If selected, udhcpc will check some options (such as option 12 -
	hostname) and if they don't look like valid hostnames
	(for example, if they start with dash or contain spaces),
	they will be replaced with string "bad" when exporting
	to the environment.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPC_DEFAULT_SCRIPT
	string "Absolute path to config script"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_UDHCPC_DEFAULT_SCRIPT
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPC || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPC6
	help
	This script is called after udhcpc receives an answer. See
	examples/udhcp for a working example. Normally it is safe
	to leave this untouched.

# udhcpc6 config is inserted here:
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPC6
	bool "udhcpc6 (21 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_UDHCPC6
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_IPV6
	help
	udhcpc6 is a DHCPv6 client

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_UDHCPC6_RFC3646
	bool "Support RFC 3646 (DNS server and search list)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_UDHCPC6_RFC3646
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPC6
	help
	List of DNS servers and domain search list can be requested with
	"-O dns" and "-O search". If server gives these values,
	they will be set in environment variables "dns" and "search".

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_UDHCPC6_RFC4704
	bool "Support RFC 4704 (Client FQDN)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_UDHCPC6_RFC4704
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPC6
	help
	You can request FQDN to be given by server using "-O fqdn".

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_UDHCPC6_RFC4833
	bool "Support RFC 4833 (Timezones)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_UDHCPC6_RFC4833
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPC6
	help
	You can request POSIX timezone with "-O tz" and timezone name
	with "-O timezone".

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_UDHCPC6_RFC5970
	bool "Support RFC 5970 (Network Boot)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_UDHCPC6_RFC5970
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPC6
	help
	You can request bootfile-url with "-O bootfile_url" and
	bootfile-params with "-O bootfile_params".

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_UDHCP_PORT
	bool "Enable '-P port' option for udhcpd and udhcpc"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_UDHCP_PORT
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPD || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPC || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPC6
	help
	At the cost of ~300 bytes, enables -P port option.
	This feature is typically not needed.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCP_DEBUG
	int "Maximum verbosity level (0..9)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_UDHCP_DEBUG
	range 0 9
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPD || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPC || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPC6 || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_DHCPRELAY
	help
	Verbosity can be increased with multiple -v options.
	This option controls how high it can be cranked up.

	Bigger values result in bigger code. Levels above 1
	are very verbose and useful for debugging only.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPC_SLACK_FOR_BUGGY_SERVERS
	int "DHCP options slack buffer size"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_UDHCPC_SLACK_FOR_BUGGY_SERVERS
	range 0 924
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPD || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPC
	help
	Some buggy DHCP servers send DHCP offer packets with option
	field larger than we expect (which might also be considered a
	buffer overflow attempt). These packets are normally discarded.
	If circumstances beyond your control force you to support such
	servers, this may help. The upper limit (924) makes udhcpc accept
	even 1500 byte packets (maximum-sized ethernet packets).

	This option does not make udhcp[cd] emit non-standard
	sized packets.

	Known buggy DHCP servers:
	3Com OfficeConnect Remote 812 ADSL Router:
		seems to confuse maximum allowed UDP packet size with
		maximum size of entire IP packet, and sends packets
		which are 28 bytes too large.
	Seednet (ISP) VDSL: sends packets 2 bytes too large.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_UDHCP_RFC3397
	bool "Support RFC 3397 domain search options"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_UDHCP_RFC3397
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPD || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPC
	help
	If selected, both client and server will support passing of domain
	search lists via option 119, specified in RFC 3397,
	and SIP servers option 120, specified in RFC 3361.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_UDHCP_8021Q
	bool "Support 802.1Q VLAN parameters options"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_UDHCP_8021Q
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPD || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UDHCPC
	help
	If selected, both client and server will support passing of VLAN
	ID and priority via options 132 and 133 as per 802.1Q.
