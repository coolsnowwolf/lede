	bool "Make tar, rpm, modprobe etc understand .xz data"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_SEAMLESS_XZ
	help
	  Make tar, rpm, modprobe etc understand .xz data.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SEAMLESS_LZMA
	bool "Make tar, rpm, modprobe etc understand .lzma data"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_SEAMLESS_LZMA

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_AR
	bool "ar"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_AR  # needs to be improved to be able to replace binutils ar
	help
	  ar is an archival utility program used to create, modify, and
	  extract contents from archives. In practice, it is used exclusively
	  for object module archives used by compilers.

	  On an x86 system, the ar applet adds about 1K.

	  Unless you have a specific application which requires ar, you should
	  probably say N here: most compilers come with their own ar utility.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_AR_LONG_FILENAMES
	bool "Support for long filenames (not needed for debs)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_AR_LONG_FILENAMES
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_AR
	help
	  By default the ar format can only store the first 15 characters
	  of the filename, this option removes that limitation.
	  It supports the GNU ar long filename method which moves multiple long
	  filenames into a the data section of a new ar entry.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_AR_CREATE
	bool "Support archive creation"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_AR_CREATE
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_AR

	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_UNCOMPRESS  # ancient
	help
	  uncompress is used to decompress archives created by compress.
	  Not much used anymore, replaced by gzip/gunzip.
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_GUNZIP
	bool "gunzip"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_GUNZIP
	help
	  gunzip is used to decompress archives created by gzip.
	  You can use the `-t' option to test the integrity of
	  an archive, without decompressing it.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_GUNZIP_LONG_OPTIONS
	bool "Enable long options"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_GUNZIP_LONG_OPTIONS
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_GUNZIP && BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LONG_OPTS
	help
	  Enable use of long options.
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_BUNZIP2
	bool "bunzip2"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_BUNZIP2
	help
	  bunzip2 is a compression utility using the Burrows-Wheeler block
	  sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression
	  is generally considerably better than that achieved by more
	  conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the
	  performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.

	  Unless you have a specific application which requires bunzip2, you
	  should probably say N here.
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UNLZMA
	bool "unlzma"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_UNLZMA
	help
	  unlzma is a compression utility using the Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain
	  compression algorithm, and range coding. Compression
	  is generally considerably better than that achieved by the bzip2
	  compressors.

	  The BusyBox unlzma applet is limited to decompression only.
	  On an x86 system, this applet adds about 4K.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_LZMA_FAST
	bool "Optimize unlzma for speed"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_LZMA_FAST
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UNLZMA

	  This option reduces decompression time by about 25% at the cost of
	  a 1K bigger binary.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LZMA
	bool "Provide lzma alias which supports only unpacking"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_LZMA
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UNLZMA
	help
	  Enable this option if you want commands like "lzma -d" to work.
	  IOW: you'll get lzma applet, but it will always require -d option.
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UNXZ
	bool "unxz"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_UNXZ
	help
	  unxz is a unlzma successor.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_XZ
	bool "Provide xz alias which supports only unpacking"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_XZ
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UNXZ
	help
	  Enable this option if you want commands like "xz -d" to work.
	  IOW: you'll get xz applet, but it will always require -d option.
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_BZIP2
	bool "bzip2"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_BZIP2
	help
	  bzip2 is a compression utility using the Burrows-Wheeler block

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_CPIO
	bool "cpio"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_CPIO
	help
	  cpio is an archival utility program used to create, modify, and
	  extract contents from archives.
	  cpio has 110 bytes of overheads for every stored file.

	  This implementation of cpio can extract cpio archives created in the
	  "newc" or "crc" format, it cannot create or modify them.

	  Unless you have a specific application which requires cpio, you
	  should probably say N here.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_CPIO_O
	bool "Support for archive creation"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_CPIO_O
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_CPIO
	help
	  This implementation of cpio can create cpio archives in the "newc"
	  format only.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_CPIO_P

	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SEAMLESS_GZ
	help
	  dpkg is a medium-level tool to install, build, remove and manage
	  Debian packages.

	  This implementation of dpkg has a number of limitations,

	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_DPKG_DEB
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SEAMLESS_GZ

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DPKG_DEB_EXTRACT_ONLY
	bool "Extract only (-x)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_DPKG_DEB_EXTRACT_ONLY
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_DPKG_DEB
	help
	  This reduces dpkg-deb to the equivalent of
	  "ar -p <deb> data.tar.gz | tar -zx". However it saves space as none
	  of the extra dpkg-deb, ar or tar options are needed, they are linked
	  to internally.
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_GZIP
	bool "gzip"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_GZIP
	help
	  gzip is used to compress files.
	  It's probably the most widely used UNIX compression program.

	  High levels (7,8,9) of lzop compression. These levels
	  are actually slower than gzip at equivalent compression ratios
	  and take up 3.2K of code.
