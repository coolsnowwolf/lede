	/proc/acpi/event (though it is marked deprecated it is still widely
	used and _is_ a standard) or in binary form from specified evdevs
	(just use /dev/input/event*).

	It parses the event to retrieve ACTION and a possible PARAMETER.
	It then spawns /etc/acpi/<ACTION>[/<PARAMETER>] either via run-parts
	(if the resulting path is a directory) or directly as an executable.

	N.B. acpid relies on run-parts so have the latter installed.

	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FDFLUSH
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_PLATFORM_LINUX

	fdflush is only needed when changing media on slightly-broken
	removable media drives. It is used to make Linux believe that a
	hardware disk-change switch has been actuated, which causes Linux to
	forget anything it has cached from the previous media. If you have
	such a slightly-broken drive, you will need to run fdflush every time

	this disabled.

	bool "getopt (5.8 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_GETOPT
	help
	The getopt utility is used to break up (parse) options in command
	lines to make it easy to write complex shell scripts that also check
	for legal (and illegal) options. If you want to write horribly
	complex shell scripts, or use some horribly complex shell script
	written by others, this utility may be for you. Most people will
	wisely leave this disabled.

	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HEXDUMP
	help
	The hexdump utility is used to display binary data in an ascii
	readable way. This option creates binary data from an ascii input.
	NB: this option is non-standard. It's unwise to use it in scripts
	aimed to be portable.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HD

	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	The hwclock utility is used to read and set the hardware clock
	on a system. This is primarily used to set the current time on
	shutdown in the hardware clock, so the hardware will keep the
	correct time when Linux is _not_ running.

	The mkswap utility is used to configure a file or disk partition as
	Linux swap space. This allows Linux to use the entire file or
	partition as if it were additional RAM, which can greatly increase
	the capability of low-memory machines. This additional memory is
	much slower than real RAM, but can be very helpful at preventing your
	applications being killed by the Linux out of memory (OOM) killer.
	Once you have created swap space using 'mkswap' you need to enable

	The switch_root utility is used from initramfs to select a new
	root device. Under initramfs, you have to use this instead of
	pivot_root. (Stop reading here if you don't care why.)

	Booting with initramfs extracts a gzipped cpio archive into rootfs
	(which is a variant of ramfs/tmpfs). Because rootfs can't be moved
	or unmounted*, pivot_root will not work from initramfs. Instead,
	switch_root deletes everything out of rootfs (including itself),
	does a mount --move that overmounts rootfs with the new root, and
	then execs the specified init program.

	* Because the Linux kernel uses rootfs internally as the starting
	and ending point for searching through the kernel's doubly linked
	list of active mount points. That's why.

	help
	Enabling this feature allows automatic mounting of files (containing
	filesystem images) via the linux kernel's loopback devices.
	The mount command will detect you are trying to mount a file instead
	of a block device, and transparently associate the file with a
	loopback device. The umount command will also free that loopback
	device.

	You can still use the 'losetup' utility (to manually associate files
	with loop devices) if you need to do something advanced, such as
	specify an offset or cryptographic options to the loopback device.
	(If you don't want umount to free the loop device, use "umount -D".)

	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_MOUNT_FAKE
	help
	Historically, Unix systems kept track of the currently mounted
	partitions in the file "/etc/mtab". These days, the kernel exports
	the list of currently mounted partitions in "/proc/mounts", rendering
	the old mtab file obsolete. (In modern systems, /etc/mtab should be
	a symlink to /proc/mounts.)

	The only reason to have mount maintain an /etc/mtab file itself is if
	your stripped-down embedded system does not have a /proc directory.
	If you must use this, keep in mind it's inherently brittle (for
	example a mount under chroot won't update it), can't handle modern
	features like separate per-process filesystem namespaces, requires
	that your /etc directory be writable, tends to get easily confused
	by --bind or --move mounts, won't update if you rename a directory
	that contains a mount point, and so on. (In brief: avoid.)

	About the only reason to use this is if you've removed /proc from
	your kernel.
