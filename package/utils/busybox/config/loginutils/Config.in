config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SHADOWPASSWDS
	bool "Support shadow passwords"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_SHADOWPASSWDS
	help
	Build support for shadow password in /etc/shadow. This file is only
	readable by root and thus the encrypted passwords are no longer
	publicly readable.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_USE_BB_PWD_GRP
	bool "Use internal password and group functions rather than system functions"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_USE_BB_PWD_GRP
	help
	If you leave this disabled, busybox will use the system's password
	and group functions. And if you are using the GNU C library
	(glibc), you will then need to install the /etc/nsswitch.conf
	configuration file and the required /lib/libnss_* libraries in
	order for the password and group functions to work. This generally
	makes your embedded system quite a bit larger.

	Enabling this option will cause busybox to directly access the
	system's /etc/password, /etc/group files (and your system will be
	smaller, and I will get fewer emails asking about how glibc NSS
	works). When this option is enabled, you will not be able to use
	PAM to access remote LDAP password servers and whatnot. And if you
	want hostname resolution to work with glibc, you still need the
	/lib/libnss_* libraries.

	If you need to use glibc's nsswitch.conf mechanism
	(e.g. if user/group database is NOT stored in /etc/passwd etc),
	you must NOT use this option.

	If you enable this option, it will add about 1.5k.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_USE_BB_SHADOW
	bool "Use internal shadow password functions"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_USE_BB_SHADOW
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_USE_BB_PWD_GRP && BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SHADOWPASSWDS
	help
	If you leave this disabled, busybox will use the system's shadow
	password handling functions. And if you are using the GNU C library
	(glibc), you will then need to install the /etc/nsswitch.conf
	configuration file and the required /lib/libnss_* libraries in
	order for the shadow password functions to work. This generally
	makes your embedded system quite a bit larger.

	Enabling this option will cause busybox to directly access the
	system's /etc/shadow file when handling shadow passwords. This
	makes your system smaller (and I will get fewer emails asking about
	how glibc NSS works). When this option is enabled, you will not be
	able to use PAM to access shadow passwords from remote LDAP
	password servers and whatnot.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_USE_BB_CRYPT
	bool "Use internal crypt functions"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_USE_BB_CRYPT
	help
	Busybox has internal DES and MD5 crypt functions.
	They produce results which are identical to corresponding
	standard C library functions.

	If you leave this disabled, busybox will use the system's
	crypt functions. Most C libraries use large (~70k)
	static buffers there, and also combine them with more general
	DES encryption/decryption.

	For busybox, having large static buffers is undesirable,
	especially on NOMMU machines. Busybox also doesn't need
	DES encryption/decryption and can do with smaller code.

	If you enable this option, it will add about 4.8k of code
	if you are building dynamically linked executable.
	In static build, it makes code _smaller_ by about 1.2k,
	and likely many kilobytes less of bss.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_USE_BB_CRYPT_SHA
	bool "Enable SHA256/512 crypt functions"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_USE_BB_CRYPT_SHA
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_USE_BB_CRYPT
	help
	Enable this if you have passwords starting with "$5$" or "$6$"
	in your /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow files. These passwords
	are hashed using SHA256 and SHA512 algorithms. Support for them
	was added to glibc in 2008.
	With this option off, login will fail password check for any
	user which has password encrypted with these algorithms.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ADD_SHELL
	bool "add-shell (3.1 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_ADD_SHELL if BUSYBOX_CONFIG_DESKTOP
	help
	Add shells to /etc/shells.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_REMOVE_SHELL
	bool "remove-shell (3 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_REMOVE_SHELL if BUSYBOX_CONFIG_DESKTOP
	help
	Remove shells from /etc/shells.
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ADDGROUP
	bool "addgroup (8.6 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_ADDGROUP
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LONG_OPTS
	help
	Utility for creating a new group account.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_ADDUSER_TO_GROUP
	bool "Support adding users to groups"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_ADDUSER_TO_GROUP
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ADDGROUP
	help
	If called with two non-option arguments,
	addgroup will add an existing user to an
	existing group.
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ADDUSER
	bool "adduser (15 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_ADDUSER
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LONG_OPTS
	help
	Utility for creating a new user account.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_CHECK_NAMES
	bool "Enable sanity check on user/group names in adduser and addgroup"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_CHECK_NAMES
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ADDUSER || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ADDGROUP
	help
	Enable sanity check on user and group names in adduser and addgroup.
	To avoid problems, the user or group name should consist only of
	letters, digits, underscores, periods, at signs and dashes,
	and not start with a dash (as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1-2001).
	For compatibility with Samba machine accounts "$" is also supported
	at the end of the user or group name.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LAST_ID
	int "Last valid uid or gid for adduser and addgroup"
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ADDUSER || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ADDGROUP

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_CHPASSWD
	bool "chpasswd (18 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_CHPASSWD
	help
	Reads a file of user name and password pairs from standard input
	and uses this information to update a group of existing users.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DEFAULT_PASSWD_ALGO
	string "Default encryption method (passwd -a, cryptpw -m, chpasswd -c ALG)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_DEFAULT_PASSWD_ALGO
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_PASSWD || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_CRYPTPW || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_CHPASSWD
	help
	Possible choices are "d[es]", "m[d5]", "s[ha256]" or "sha512".
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_CRYPTPW

	help
	Encrypts the given password with the crypt(3) libc function
	using the given salt.

	bool "mkpasswd (15 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_MKPASSWD
	help
	Encrypts the given password with the crypt(3) libc function
	using the given salt. Debian has this utility under mkpasswd
	name. Busybox provides mkpasswd as an alias for cryptpw.
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_DELUSER
	bool "deluser (9.1 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_DELUSER

	If called with two non-option arguments, deluser
	or delgroup will remove an user from a specified group.
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_GETTY
	bool "getty (10 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_GETTY
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SYSLOG
	help
	getty lets you log in on a tty. It is normally invoked by init.

	Note that you can save a few bytes by disabling it and
	using login applet directly.
	If you need to reset tty attributes before calling login,
	this script approximates getty:

	exec </dev/$1 >/dev/$1 2>&1 || exit 1
	reset
	stty sane; stty ispeed 38400; stty ospeed 38400
	printf "%s login: " "`hostname`"

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LOGIN
	bool "login (24 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_LOGIN
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SYSLOG
	help
	login is used when signing onto a system.

	Note that busybox binary must be setuid root for this applet to
	work properly.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LOGIN_SESSION_AS_CHILD
	bool "Run logged in session in a child process"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_LOGIN_SESSION_AS_CHILD if BUSYBOX_CONFIG_PAM
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LOGIN
	help
	Run the logged in session in a child process.  This allows
	login to clean up things such as utmp entries or PAM sessions
	when the login session is complete.  If you use PAM, you
	almost always would want this to be set to Y, else PAM session
	will not be cleaned up.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LOGIN_SCRIPTS
	bool "Support login scripts"
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LOGIN
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_LOGIN_SCRIPTS

	without leading /dev/) on which root is allowed to login.
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_PASSWD
	bool "passwd (21 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_PASSWD
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SYSLOG
	help
	passwd changes passwords for user and group accounts. A normal user
	may only change the password for his/her own account, the super user
	may change the password for any account. The administrator of a group
	may change the password for the group.

	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_SU
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SYSLOG
	help
	su is used to become another user during a login session.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SULOGIN
	bool "sulogin (17 kb)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_SULOGIN
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SYSLOG
