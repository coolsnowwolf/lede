config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SHADOWPASSWDS
	bool "Support for shadow passwords"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_SHADOWPASSWDS
	help
	  Build support for shadow password in /etc/shadow. This file is only
	  readable by root and thus the encrypted passwords are no longer
	  publicly readable.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_USE_BB_PWD_GRP
	bool "Use internal password and group functions rather than system functions"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_USE_BB_PWD_GRP
	help
	  If you leave this disabled, busybox will use the system's password
	  and group functions. And if you are using the GNU C library
	  (glibc), you will then need to install the /etc/nsswitch.conf
	  configuration file and the required /lib/libnss_* libraries in
	  order for the password and group functions to work. This generally
	  makes your embedded system quite a bit larger.

	  Enabling this option will cause busybox to directly access the
	  system's /etc/password, /etc/group files (and your system will be
	  smaller, and I will get fewer emails asking about how glibc NSS
	  works). When this option is enabled, you will not be able to use
	  PAM to access remote LDAP password servers and whatnot. And if you
	  want hostname resolution to work with glibc, you still need the
	  /lib/libnss_* libraries.

	  If you need to use glibc's nsswitch.conf mechanism
	  (e.g. if user/group database is NOT stored in /etc/passwd etc),
	  you must NOT use this option.

	  If you enable this option, it will add about 1.5k.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_USE_BB_SHADOW
	bool "Use internal shadow password functions"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_USE_BB_SHADOW
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_USE_BB_PWD_GRP && BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SHADOWPASSWDS
	help
	  If you leave this disabled, busybox will use the system's shadow
	  password handling functions. And if you are using the GNU C library
	  (glibc), you will then need to install the /etc/nsswitch.conf
	  configuration file and the required /lib/libnss_* libraries in
	  order for the shadow password functions to work. This generally
	  makes your embedded system quite a bit larger.

	  Enabling this option will cause busybox to directly access the
	  system's /etc/shadow file when handling shadow passwords. This
	  makes your system smaller (and I will get fewer emails asking about
	  how glibc NSS works). When this option is enabled, you will not be
	  able to use PAM to access shadow passwords from remote LDAP
	  password servers and whatnot.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_USE_BB_CRYPT
	bool "Use internal crypt functions"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_USE_BB_CRYPT
	help
	  Busybox has internal DES and MD5 crypt functions.
	  They produce results which are identical to corresponding
	  standard C library functions.

	  If you leave this disabled, busybox will use the system's
	  crypt functions. Most C libraries use large (~70k)
	  static buffers there, and also combine them with more general
	  DES encryption/decryption.

	  For busybox, having large static buffers is undesirable,
	  especially on NOMMU machines. Busybox also doesn't need
	  DES encryption/decryption and can do with smaller code.

	  If you enable this option, it will add about 4.8k of code
	  if you are building dynamically linked executable.
	  In static build, it makes code _smaller_ by about 1.2k,
	  and likely many kilobytes less of bss.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_USE_BB_CRYPT_SHA
	bool "Enable SHA256/512 crypt functions"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_USE_BB_CRYPT_SHA
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_USE_BB_CRYPT
	help
	  Enable this if you have passwords starting with "$5$" or "$6$"
	  in your /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow files. These passwords
	  are hashed using SHA256 and SHA512 algorithms. Support for them
	  was added to glibc in 2008.
	  With this option off, login will fail password check for any
	  user which has password encrypted with these algorithms.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ADD_SHELL
       bool "add-shell"
       default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_ADD_SHELL if BUSYBOX_CONFIG_DESKTOP
       help
         Add shells to /etc/shells.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_REMOVE_SHELL
       bool "remove-shell"
       default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_REMOVE_SHELL if BUSYBOX_CONFIG_DESKTOP

	bool "Support for adding users to groups"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_ADDUSER_TO_GROUP
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ADDGROUP
	help
	  If  called  with two non-option arguments,
	  addgroup will add an existing user to an
	  existing group.
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ADDUSER
	bool "adduser"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_ADDUSER
	help
	  Utility for creating a new user account.

	bool "Enable long options"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_ADDUSER_LONG_OPTIONS
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ADDUSER && BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LONG_OPTS
	help
	  Support long options for the adduser applet.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_CHECK_NAMES
	bool "Enable sanity check on user/group names in adduser and addgroup"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_CHECK_NAMES
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ADDUSER || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_ADDGROUP
	help
	  Enable sanity check on user and group names in adduser and addgroup.
	  To avoid problems, the user or group name should consist only of
	  letters, digits, underscores, periods, at signs and dashes,
	  and not start with a dash (as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1-2001).
	  For compatibility with Samba machine accounts "$" is also supported
	  at the end of the user or group name.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_CHPASSWD
	bool "chpasswd"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_CHPASSWD
	help
	  Reads a file of user name and password pairs from standard input
	  and uses this information to update a group of existing users.

	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_MKPASSWD
	help
	  Encrypts the given password with the crypt(3) libc function
	  using the given salt. Debian has this utility under mkpasswd

	  or delgroup will remove an user from a specified group.
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_GETTY
	bool "getty"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_GETTY
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SYSLOG
	help
	  getty lets you log in on a tty. It is normally invoked by init.

	  Note that you can save a few bytes by disabling it and
	  using login applet directly.
	  If you need to reset tty attributes before calling login,
	  this script approximates getty:

	  exec </dev/$1 >/dev/$1 2>&1 || exit 1
	  reset
	  stty sane; stty ispeed 38400; stty ospeed 38400
	  printf "%s login: " "`hostname`"

	bool "Run logged in session in a child process"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_LOGIN_SESSION_AS_CHILD if BUSYBOX_CONFIG_PAM
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LOGIN
	help
	  Run the logged in session in a child process.  This allows
	  login to clean up things such as utmp entries or PAM sessions
	  when the login session is complete.  If you use PAM, you
	  almost always would want this to be set to Y, else PAM session
	  will not be cleaned up.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LOGIN_SCRIPTS
	bool "Support for login scripts"
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LOGIN
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_LOGIN_SCRIPTS

	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_NOLOGIN

	  without leading /dev/) on which root is allowed to login.
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_PASSWD
	bool "passwd"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_PASSWD
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SYSLOG
	help
	  passwd changes passwords for user and group accounts. A normal user
	  may only change the password for his/her own account, the super user
	  may change the password for any account. The administrator of a group
	  may change the password for the group.

	  Note that Busybox binary must be setuid root for this applet to
	  work properly.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_PASSWD_WEAK_CHECK
	bool "Check new passwords for weakness"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_PASSWD_WEAK_CHECK
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_PASSWD

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SU
	bool "su"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_SU
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SYSLOG
	help
	  su is used to become another user during a login session.

	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SYSLOG
	help
	  sulogin is invoked when the system goes into single user
	  mode (this is done through an entry in inittab).
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_VLOCK
	bool "vlock"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_VLOCK
	help
	  Build the "vlock" applet which allows you to lock (virtual) terminals.
