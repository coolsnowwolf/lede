config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_BOOTCHARTD
	bool "bootchartd"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_BOOTCHARTD
	help
	  bootchartd is commonly used to profile the boot process
	  for the purpose of speeding it up. In this case, it is started
	  by the kernel as the init process. This is configured by adding
	  the init=/sbin/bootchartd option to the kernel command line.

	  It can also be used to monitor the resource usage of a specific
	  application or the running system in general. In this case,
	  bootchartd is started interactively by running bootchartd start
	  and stopped using bootchartd stop.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_BOOTCHARTD_BLOATED_HEADER
	bool "Compatible, bloated header"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_BOOTCHARTD_BLOATED_HEADER
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_BOOTCHARTD
	help
	  Create extended header file compatible with "big" bootchartd.
	  "Big" bootchartd is a shell script and it dumps some
	  "convenient" info int the header, such as:
	    title = Boot chart for `hostname` (`date`)
	    system.uname = `uname -srvm`
	    system.release = `cat /etc/DISTRO-release`
	    system.cpu = `grep '^model name' /proc/cpuinfo | head -1` ($cpucount)
	    system.kernel.options = `cat /proc/cmdline`
	  This data is not mandatory for bootchart graph generation,
	  and is considered bloat. Nevertheless, this option
	  makes bootchartd applet to dump a subset of it.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_BOOTCHARTD_CONFIG_FILE
	bool "Support bootchartd.conf"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_BOOTCHARTD_CONFIG_FILE
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_BOOTCHARTD
	help
	  Enable reading and parsing of $PWD/bootchartd.conf
	  and /etc/bootchartd.conf files.
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HALT
	bool "poweroff, halt, and reboot"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_HALT
	help
	  Stop all processes and either halt, reboot, or power off the system.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_CALL_TELINIT
	bool "Call telinit on shutdown and reboot"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_CALL_TELINIT
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HALT && !BUSYBOX_CONFIG_INIT
	help
	  Call an external program (normally telinit) to facilitate
	  a switch to a proper runlevel.

	  This option is only available if you selected halt and friends,
	  but did not select init.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_TELINIT_PATH
	string "Path to telinit executable"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_TELINIT_PATH
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_CALL_TELINIT
	help
	  When busybox halt and friends have to call external telinit
	  to facilitate proper shutdown, this path is to be used when
	  locating telinit executable.
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_INIT
	bool "init"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_INIT
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SYSLOG
	help
	  init is the first program run when the system boots.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LINUXRC
	bool "Support running init from within an initrd (not initramfs)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_LINUXRC
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SYSLOG
	help
	  Legacy support for running init under the old-style initrd. Allows
	  the name linuxrc to act as init, and it doesn't assume init is PID 1.

	  This does not apply to initramfs, which runs /init as PID 1 and
	  requires no special support.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_USE_INITTAB
	bool "Support reading an inittab file"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_USE_INITTAB
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_INIT || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LINUXRC
	help
	  Allow init to read an inittab file when the system boot.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_KILL_REMOVED
	bool "Support killing processes that have been removed from inittab"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_KILL_REMOVED
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_USE_INITTAB
	help
	  When respawn entries are removed from inittab and a SIGHUP is
	  sent to init, this option will make init kill the processes
	  that have been removed.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_KILL_DELAY
	int "How long to wait between TERM and KILL (0 - send TERM only)" if FEATURE_KILL_REMOVED
	range 0 1024
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_KILL_DELAY
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_KILL_REMOVED
	help
	  With nonzero setting, init sends TERM, forks, child waits N
	  seconds, sends KILL and exits. Setting it too high is unwise
	  (child will hang around for too long and could actually kill
	  the wrong process!)

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_INIT_SCTTY
	bool "Run commands with leading dash with controlling tty"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_INIT_SCTTY
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_INIT || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LINUXRC
	help
	  If this option is enabled, init will try to give a controlling
	  tty to any command which has leading hyphen (often it's "-/bin/sh").
	  More precisely, init will do "ioctl(STDIN_FILENO, TIOCSCTTY, 0)".
	  If device attached to STDIN_FILENO can be a ctty but is not yet
	  a ctty for other session, it will become this process' ctty.
	  This is not the traditional init behavour, but is often what you want
	  in an embedded system where the console is only accessed during
	  development or for maintenance.
	  NB: using cttyhack applet may work better.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_INIT_SYSLOG
	bool "Enable init to write to syslog"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_INIT_SYSLOG
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_INIT || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LINUXRC

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_EXTRA_QUIET
	bool "Be _extra_ quiet on boot"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_EXTRA_QUIET
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_INIT || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LINUXRC
	help
	  Prevent init from logging some messages to the console during boot.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_INIT_COREDUMPS
	bool "Support dumping core for child processes (debugging only)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_INIT_COREDUMPS
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_INIT || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LINUXRC
	help
	  If this option is enabled and the file /.init_enable_core
	  exists, then init will call setrlimit() to allow unlimited
	  core file sizes. If this option is disabled, processes
	  will not generate any core files.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_INIT_TERMINAL_TYPE
	string "Initial terminal type"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_INIT_TERMINAL_TYPE
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_INIT || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LINUXRC
	help
	  This is the initial value set by init for the TERM environment
	  variable. This variable is used by programs which make use of
	  extended terminal capabilities.

	  Note that on Linux, init attempts to detect serial terminal and
	  sets TERM to "vt102" if one is found.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_INIT_MODIFY_CMDLINE
	bool "Modify the command-line to \"init\""
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_INIT_MODIFY_CMDLINE
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_INIT || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LINUXRC
	help
	  When launched as PID 1 and after parsing its arguments, init
	  wipes all the arguments but argv[0] and rewrites argv[0] to
	  contain only "init", so that its command-line appears solely as
	  "init" in tools such as ps.
	  If this option is set to Y, init will keep its original behavior,
	  otherwise, all the arguments including argv[0] will be preserved,
	  be they parsed or ignored by init.
	  The original command-line used to launch init can then be
	  retrieved in /proc/1/cmdline on Linux, for example.
config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_MESG
	bool "mesg"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_MESG
	help
	  Mesg controls access to your terminal by others. It is typically
	  used to allow or disallow other users to write to your terminal

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_MESG_ENABLE_ONLY_GROUP
	bool "Enable writing to tty only by group, not by everybody"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_MESG_ENABLE_ONLY_GROUP
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_MESG
	help
	  Usually, ttys are owned by group "tty", and "write" tool is
	  setgid to this group. This way, "mesg y" only needs to enable
	  "write by owning group" bit in tty mode.

	  If you set this option to N, "mesg y" will enable writing
	  by anybody at all. This is not recommended.
