          Enabling this allows full customization of busybox settings.
          Note that there are many options here that can result in a build
          that doesn't work properly.  Enabling customization will mark your
          build as "tainted" for the purpose of bug reports.
          See the variables written to /etc/openwrt_release

          Unless you know what you are doing, you should leave this as 'n'
