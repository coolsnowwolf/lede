[V4.0.0.6 ]
Host Driver:
1.Add tx power percentage function for iPA
2. Modify AP PS, use CR replace AP PS CMD
3.fix apcli vs DIR655 IOT can't set ba size to 21
4.Set MSSID *7, iPhone5 connect then ping overnight, still ping fail (?¶çˆ¾PSE Redirection bitè¢«è?èµ? STA ping fail)
for ps retrieve function, rename "token_enq_fail" to "token_enq_all_fail" to let it more clear.
5. MT7603 auto rate update
6. Fix [AP][TGn]:4.2.47 Power Save, fail on step 8,each PS poll the station sends to the APUT, the APUT is expected to send only one directed data packet in response.
7. Fix TGn 4.2.11 & 4.2.12 PMK cache is delete in Auth. Req.
8. add PSE logical reset when detect pse abonormal condition
9. add sw based PDMA watchdog to detect & recovery PDMA TX/RX hang

F/W:
Fix PCIE FW download fail when sw reboot, reset HIF then trigger WDT.
1. Add DMA scheduler workaround.
2. Add Admission control.
3. Add TX power % support.

1. Fixed Cal Free IC eeprom endian issue.
2. Fixed IOT issue with Linksys WUSB6300.
3. AP-client repeater: fixed icv error when authmode/encryptype update.
4. Fixed crash issue that tasklet for processing pci dma done for mcu cmd sometimes will execute after event tasklet.
5. Update auto fall back config and algorithm.
6. Update firmware to fixed FW re-download fail issue.
7. Do 802.11 header endian swap for ps retrieve packet.
8. Fixed LED command big endian issue.
9. Fixed MlmeHardTransmitTxRing cache flush issue that will cause memory for dma and cache non sync at big endian platform.
10. Modify check en/disable RTS/CTS conditions.
11. Fixed radio on/off cmd parameters to correct value.
12. Update patch for flash mode.
13. Fixed LED RadioOff issue.
14. ATE: 
    a. fixed Tx/Rx antenna switch resulting wrong Tx power level work around.
    b. patch PCIE ASPM write efuse Add PCIe Compile flag.
    c. add iwpriv TXCONT
    d. add iwpriv for carrier suppression test TXCARR
    e. Initialize Tx power with EEPROM array when ATESTART
    f. Fix CONFIG_QA blocking setting power when only CONFIG_ATE is chosen


[MT7603E_DPA_LinuxAP_4.0.0.4_20140411]
1. Support IGMP Snooping function.
2. Fix NewRateAdapt Error in STA mode.
3. Fixed apcli ICV error issue to decrypt Broadcast packet from AP.
4. Fixed BAR issues:
   a. Change SW BAR rate to CCK 1M.
   b. Send SW BAR for ap power saving to refresh peer sta side reordering buffer (Intel IOT).
   c. Add SW BAR mechanism which SN will control by wtbl per tid.
   d. Considering the BAR data rate in both 2.4G & 5G
   e. SendRefreshBar when recv. CmdPsClearRsp, this modify will make sure the 1st. packet in PSE is BAR after PS.
