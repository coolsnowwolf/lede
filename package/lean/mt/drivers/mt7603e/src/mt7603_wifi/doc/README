How to make?
1. If you want to buid the Linux AP code, set the "MODE = AP" in Makefile
   and chose the TARGET to Linux by set "TARGET = LINUX" 
   
2. If you want to build the Linux STA code, set the "MODE = STA" in Makefile
   and chose the TARGET to Linux by set "TARGET = LINUX"
   
3. If you want to buid the uCOS AP code, set the "MODE = AP" in Makefile
   and chose the TARGET to UCOS by set "TARGET = UCOS" 
   
4. If you want to build the uCOS STA code, set the "MODE = STA" in Makefile
   and chose the TARGET to uCOS by set "TARGET = UCOS"
 
5. If you wnat to clean the tree, just "make clean" it will clean the target and mode you set 

6. In os/linux/config.mk 
	define the GCC and LD of the target machine
	define the compiler flags CFLAGS
	define the linux kernel source include file path LINUX_SRC
	modify to meet your need.

7. For the Linux port , please read /include/rt_linux.h os/linux/rt_linux.c and os/linux/rt_main_dev.c

8. For the uCOS port , please read /include/rt_ucos.h os/linux/rt_ucos.c and os/ucos/rt_main_dev.c

9. For the Linux Station port, please add the Makefile section in os/linux/Makefile.

10. Currently you can build and run on your 2.4.x Linux kernel, 2.6.x not sure and not try yet.

11. In tools/bin2h.c will convert the 8051 firmware from common/rt2860.bin into include/firmware.h.
  	Which will be used by rtmp_init.c to include in the firmware image in an array.
