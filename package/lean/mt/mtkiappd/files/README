mtkiappd - user space daemon supported 802.11f protocol
          for RTxxxx a/b/g/n SoftAP driver, Ralink Technology, Corp.
=================================================================

This is the README file for the 802.11f/802.11r/802.11k daemon - mtkiappd,
which comes with RTxxxx SoftAP driver.


I. Introduction
=================================================================
mtkiappd is an optional user space component for RTxxxx SoftAP driver. 


II. 802.11f features in mtkiappd
=================================================================
IEEE Std 802.11F-2003 is a standard for inter-access point protocol(IAPP).
It can handle issues on multi-verder access point interoperability.

There are three major topics which 802.11f supported,
1. ADD-notify
2. MOVE-notify
3. CACHE-notify

mtkiappd only supports ADD-notify in current phase due to lack of support from radius server

There are three major topics which 802.11r supported,
1. Key Distribution Protocol

There are three major topics which 802.11k supported,
1. Neighbor Report

Some ethernet card needs special configuration to support multicasting.
Make sure your ethernet card support multicasting


III. How to start mtkiappd
=================================================================
Note: the broadcast/netmask address of all AP must be the same.
1. If you want to debug mtkiappd, add CFLAGS with DBG.
2. If you want to extend wifi control interface, 
   modify "MAX_WIFI_COUNT" in rtmpiapp.h. (default setting is 2)
3. First we need to compile the source code using 'make' command
4. Load RTxxxx SoftAP driver - ex: rt2860ap.ko
5. Manually start mtkiappd, type $mtkiappd
6. For wifi multi-interface, type $mtkiappd -wi ra0 -wi rai0
