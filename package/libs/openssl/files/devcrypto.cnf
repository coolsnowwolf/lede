# Leave this alone and configure algorithms with CIPERS/DIGESTS below

# Configuration commands:
# Run 'openssl engine -t -c -vv -pre DUMP_INFO devcrypto' to see a
# list of supported algorithms, along with their driver, whether they
# are hw accelerated or not, and the engine's configuration commands.

# USE_SOFTDRIVERS: specifies whether to use software (not accelerated)
# drivers (0=use only accelerated drivers, 1=allow all drivers, 2=use
# if acceleration can't be determined) [default=2]
#USE_SOFTDRIVERS = 2

# CIPHERS: either ALL, NONE, or a comma-separated list of ciphers to
# enable [default=ALL]
# It is recommended to disable the ECB ciphers; in most cases, it will
# only be used for PRNG, in small blocks, where performance is poor,
# and there may be problems with apps forking with open crypto
# contexts, leading to failures.  The CBC ciphers work well:
#CIPHERS=DES-CBC, DES-EDE3-CBC, AES-128-CBC, AES-192-CBC, AES-256-CBC

# DIGESTS: either ALL, NONE, or a comma-separated list of digests to
# enable [default=NONE]
# It is strongly recommended not to enable digests; their performance
# is poor, and there are many cases in which they will not work,
# especially when calling fork with open crypto contexts.  Openssh,
# for example, does this, and you may not be able to login.
#DIGESTS = NONE
