Copyright status on all included code:

All files which have no copyright comments are original works
Copyright (C) 2005-2006 Rich Felker. The decision to exclude such
comments is intentional, as it should be possible to carry around the
complete source code on tiny storage media. All public header files
(include/*) should be treated as Public Domain as they intentionally
contain no content which can be covered by copyright. Some source
modules may fall in this category as well. If you believe that a file
is so trivial that it should be in the Public Domain, please contact
me and, if I agree, I will explicitly release it from copyright.

Some code has been modified by the OpenWrt project, this includes
the conversion from char map files to C arrays and the iconv.h header
file in particular.

The library as a whole is licensed under the GNU LGPL version 2.1.
