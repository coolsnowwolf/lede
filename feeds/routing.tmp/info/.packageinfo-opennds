Description:   openNDS is a Captive Portal solution that offers an instant way to provide restricted access to the Internet.
  With little or no configuration, a dynamically generated and adaptive splash page sequence is automatically served.
  Both client driven Captive Portal Detection (CPD) and gateway driven Captive Portal Identification (CPI - RFC 8910 and RFC 8908) are supported.
  Internet access is granted by either a click to continue button, or after credential verification as a result of filling in a login form.
  The package incorporates the FAS API allowing many flexible customisation options.
  The creation of sophisticated third party authentication applications is fully supported.
  Internet hosted https portals can be implemented with no security errors, to inspire maximum user confidence.
  This version requires iptables-nft.
