Description:   Prince is an open source implementation of the PopRouting Algorithm.
  It has been developed as a Google Summer of Code Project in collaboration with Freifunk and the University of Trento.

  Prince fetches topology data from a Link State routing daemon (OONF, OLSR, OSPF, etc),
  calculates the betweenness centrality using the topology and then computes the
  the timers' optimal values using these data. At the end of the computation the timers are pushed back to the routing daemon.
  Since v0.4 it supports both OONF and OLSRd.
