Title: Watchdog for IPv6 links
Maintainer: Nick Hainke <vincent@systemli.org>
Source: 
License: GPL-2.0-only
Type: ipkg
Description: Reboots or triggers watchdog if no link-local neighbor is available.

Important:
Be careful when you do a sysupgrade. Stop naywatch first, and make
sure procd took control again of the watchdog.
You can do this using 'ubus call system watchdog'.  Status should be "running".
