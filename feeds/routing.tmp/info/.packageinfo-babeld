Description:   Babel is a loop-avoiding distance-vector routing protocol for IPv6 and IPv4
  with fast convergence properties. It is based on the ideas in DSDV, AODV and
  Cisco's EIGRP, but is designed to work well not only in wired networks but
  also in wireless mesh networks, and has been extended with support for
  overlay networks. Babel is in the process of becoming an IETF Standard.
