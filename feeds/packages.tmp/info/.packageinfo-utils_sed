Description: sed (stream editor) is a non-interactive command-line text editor. sed is commonly 
used to filter text, i.e., it takes text input, performs some operation (or set of 
operations) on it, and outputs the modified text. sed is typically used for 
extracting part of a file using pattern matching or substituting multiple 
occurrences of a string within a file.
