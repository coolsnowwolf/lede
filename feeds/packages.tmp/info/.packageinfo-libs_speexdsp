Title: Open source speech compression codec library output to DSP
Maintainer: Peter Wagner <tripolar@gmx.at>
Source: speexdsp-1.2.0.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description: 	Open source patent-free speech compression codec library.
	Speex is an Open Source/Free Software patent-free audio compression
	format designed for speech. The Speex Project aims to lower the
	barrier of entry for voice applications by providing a free
	alternative to expensive proprietary speech codecs. Moreover, Speex
	is well-adapted to Internet applications and provides useful features
	that are not present in most other codecs.

	This package contains the shared dsp library, needed by other programs.
