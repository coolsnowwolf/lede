Description:   SCons is an Open Source software construction tool—that is, a
  next-generation build tool. Think of SCons as an improved, cross-platform
  substitute for the classic Make utility with integrated functionality
  similar to autoconf/automake and compiler caches such as ccache. In short,
  SCons is an easier, more reliable and faster way to build software.
