project from University of Tsukuba, Japan. SoftEther VPN has strong compatibility to today's most popular VPN products among the world. It has the interoperability
with OpenVPN, L2TP, IPsec, EtherIP, L2TPv3, Cisco VPN Routers and MS-SSTP VPN Clients. SoftEther VPN is the world's only VPN software which supports SSL-VPN,
OpenVPN, L2TP, EtherIP, L2TPv3 and IPsec as a single VPN software. SoftEther VPN is not only an alternative VPN server to existing VPN products (OpenVPN,
