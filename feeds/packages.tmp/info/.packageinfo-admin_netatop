Maintainer: Toni Uhlig <matzeton@googlemail.com>
Source: netatop-3.1.tar.gz
License: GPL-2.0
Type: ipkg
Description:   The optional kernel module netatop can be loaded to gather statistics about
  the TCP and UDP packets that have been transmitted/received per process and
  per thread. As soon as atop discovers that this module is active, it shows
  the columns SNET and RNET in the generic screen for the number of transmitted
  and received packets per process. When the 'n' key is pressed, it shows
  detailed counters about the number packets transmitted/received via TCP and
  UDP, the average sizes of these packets, and the total bandwidth consumed
  for input and output per process/thread.

Title: network counter for atop
Maintainer: Toni Uhlig <matzeton@googlemail.com>
Source: netatop-3.1.tar.gz
License: GPL-2.0
Type: ipkg
Description:   The daemon netatopd is packaged with the netatop kernel module. This
  daemon takes care that information is gathered about processes that are
  finished. For every finished process that has transferred network packets,
  a binary record is written to a dedicated logfile. The added records in the
  logfile are read by atop with every sample to show information about the
  network activity of finished processes as well.
