Description:  The klish is a framework for implementing a CISCO-like CLI on a UNIX
 systems. It is configurable by XML files. The KLISH stands for Kommand
 Line Interface Shell.
 The klish is a fork of clish 0.7.3 developed by Graeme McKerrell.
 It defines new features but it's compatible (as much as possible) with
 clish's XML configuration files.
 klish is able to run using clish XML configuration files although
 current clish users may expect some changes in behavior.
 Konf and konfd are klish utilities that are used to store configuration
 informations in a way which is similar to what's found on CISCO devices.
 More information about these tools is to be found on the klish web site.
