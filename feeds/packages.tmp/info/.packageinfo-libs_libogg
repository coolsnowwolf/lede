Description: Ogg project codecs use the Ogg bitstream format to arrange the raw,
compressed bitstream into a more robust, useful form.  For example,
the Ogg bitstream makes seeking, time stamping and error recovery
possible, as well as mixing several sepearate, concurrent media
streams into a single physical bitstream.
