Description:  LibTorrent is a BitTorrent library written in C++ for *nix, with a focus on
 high performance and good code. The library differentiates itself from other
 implementations by transferring directly from file pages to the network stack.
 On high-bandwidth connections it is able to seed at 3 times the speed of the
 official client.
