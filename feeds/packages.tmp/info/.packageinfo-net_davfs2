Title: Mount a WebDAV resource as a regular file system.

Description:  Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV), an extension to the HTTP-protocol,
 allows authoring of resources on a remote web server.davfs2 provides the ability to
 access such resources like a typical filesystem, allowing for use by standard
 applications with no built-in support for WebDAV.

 davfs2 is designed to fully integrate into the filesystem semantics of Unix-like
 systems (mount, umount, etc.). davfs2 makes mounting by unprivileged users as easy
 and secure as possible.

 davfs2 does extensive caching to make the file system responsive, to avoid
 unnecessary network traffic and to prevent data loss, and to cope for slow or
 unreliable connections.

 davfs2 will work with most WebDAV servers needing little or no configuration.
