Title: UltraVNC repeater for Linux
Maintainer: Jirka Spicak <robutek@gmail.com> 
Source: repeater014.zip
License: GPL-2.0
Type: ipkg
Description:  Viewer can be behind Nat router or directly connected to the internet 
 instead of forwarding serveral ports, you only need to forward 1 port. 
 If the PC that runs the Repeater has access to the local DNS server, 
 you can use your local DNS names instead of 10.10.10.12.
 This could be handy when you have a dynamic DHCP server allocating 
 ip adresses for your PC.
