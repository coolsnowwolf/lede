Description:   A port of Cumulus BFD daemon to a more portable daemon.

  Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is a network protocol that is used to
  detect faults between two forwarding engines connected by a link. It provides
  low-overhead detection of faults even on physical media that doesn't support
  failure detection of any kind, such as Ethernet, virtual circuits, tunnels and
  MPLS Label Switched Paths.
