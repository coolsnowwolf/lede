Description:   2to3 is a Python program that reads Python 2.x source code and applies a
  series of fixers to transform it into valid Python 3.x code. The standard
  library contains a rich set of fixers that will handle almost all code. 2to3
  supporting library lib2to3 is, however, a flexible and generic library, so it
  is possible to write your own fixers for 2to3. lib2to3 could also be adapted
  to custom applications in which Python code needs to be edited automatically.
