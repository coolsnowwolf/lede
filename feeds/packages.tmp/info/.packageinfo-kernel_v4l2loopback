Title: v4l2loopback kernel module
Maintainer: Michel Promonet <michel.promonet@free.fr>
Source: v4l2loopback-0.13.2.tar.xz
Type: ipkg
Description:   This module allows you to create "virtual video devices".
  Normal (v4l2) applications will read these devices as if
  they were ordinary video devices, but the video will not be
  read from e.g. a capture card but instead it is generated
  by another application.
