Description:   Reaver has been designed to be a robust and practical attack against Wi-Fi
  Protected Setup (WPS) registrar PINs in order to recover WPA/WPA2
  passphrases. It has been tested against a wide variety of access points and
  WPS implementations.

  This is reaver-wps-fork-t6x, a community forked version, which has included
  various bug fixes and additional attack method (the offline Pixie Dust
  attack).
