Description:  Mg is intended to be a small, fast, and portable editor for people who
 can't (or don't want to) run emacs for one reason or another, or are not
 familiar with the vi editor. It is compatible with emacs because there
 shouldn't be any reason to learn more editor types than emacs or vi.
