Description:   Libmraa is a C/C++ library with bindings to Java, Python and JavaScript to interface
with the IO on Galileo, Edison & other platforms, with a structured and sane API where
port names/numbering matches the board that you are on. Use of libmraa does not tie you
to specific hardware with board detection done at runtime you can create portable code
that will work across the supported platforms.

This package contains the C/C++ libraries.
