Description: 	takes a list of prefixes in conventional format on stdin, and performs two
	optimisations to reduce the length of the prefix list. It removes any
	supplied prefixes which are supurfluous because they are already included in
	another supplied prefix (e.g., 203.97.2.0/24 would be removed if
	203.97.0.0/17 was also supplied), and identifies adjacent prefixes that can
	be combined under a single, shorter-length prefix (e.g., 203.97.2.0/24 and
	203.97.3.0/24 can be combined into the single prefix 203.97.2.0/23).
