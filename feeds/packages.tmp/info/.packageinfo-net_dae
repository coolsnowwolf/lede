Description:   dae, means goose, is a lightweight and high-performance transparent
  proxy solution.

  In order to improve the traffic diversion performance as much as possible,
  dae runs the transparent proxy and traffic diversion suite in the linux
  kernel by eBPF. Therefore, we have the opportunity to make the direct
  traffic bypass the forwarding by proxy application and achieve true direct
  traffic through. Under such a magic trick, there is almost no performance
  loss and additional resource consumption for direct traffic.
