Description: 	The Shoreline Firewall, is high-level tool for configuring Netfilter.

	Shorewall6 allows for central administration of multiple IPv6 firewalls
	through use of Shorewall6 lite. The full Shorewall6 product is installed
	on a central administrative system where compiled Shorewall6 scripts are
	generated. These scripts are copied to the firewall systems where they
	run under the control of Shorewall6-lite.

	Note: This is the IPv6 implementation of Shorewall.
