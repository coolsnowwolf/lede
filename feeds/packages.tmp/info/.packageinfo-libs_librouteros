Description:   librouteros is a library to communicate with RouterOS, the operating system of MikroTik's RouterBoards.
  It uses the API port provided by those systems to connect and talk to the devices. librouteros is a
  low-level library in that it abstracts the network protocol used but has next to no knowledge about the
  commands and responses available
