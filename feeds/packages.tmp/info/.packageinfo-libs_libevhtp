Title: A more flexible replacement for libevent's httpd API
Maintainer: Gergely Kiss <mail.gery@gmail.com>

Description:    Libevhtp was created as a replacement API for Libevent's current HTTP API.
   The reality of libevent's http interface is that it was created as a JIT server,
   meaning the developer never thought of it being used for creating a full-fledged HTTP service.
