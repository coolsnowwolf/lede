Description:  PortAudio is a free, cross-platform, open-source, audio I/O library.  It lets
 you write simple audio programs in 'C' or C++ that will compile and run on many
 platforms including Windows, Macintosh OS X, and Unix (OSS/ALSA). It is
 intended to promote the exchange of audio software between developers on
 different platforms. Many applications use PortAudio for Audio I/O.
