Description: The spoofer client is part of a system to measure the Internet's
resistance to packets with a spoofed (forged) source IP address.

This package comes bundled with small certificate files that allow
secure communication with the spoofer server without depending on
the large ca-certificates package.  But if the server's private
certificate ever changes, it will be necessary to either install the
ca-certificates package or install an updated version of this package
that has a newer bundled certificate.
