Description:    Wslay is a WebSocket library written in C. It implements the protocol version 13 described
   in RFC 6455. This library offers 2 levels of API: event-based API and frame-based low-level
   API. For event-based API, it is suitable for non-blocking reactor pattern style. You can set
   callbacks in various events. For frame-based API, you can send WebSocket frame directly.
   Wslay only supports data transfer part of WebSocket protocol and does not perform opening
   handshake in HTTP.
