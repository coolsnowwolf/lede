Description: 	Tcsh is an enhanced, but completely compatible
	version of the Berkeley UNIX C shell (csh). It
	is a command language interpreter usable both
	as an interactive login shell and a shell
	script command processor. It includes a
	command-line editor, programmable word
	completion, spelling correction, a history
	mechanism, job control and a C-like syntax.
