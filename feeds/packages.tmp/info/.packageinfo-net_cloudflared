Description:   Contains the command-line client for Cloudflare Tunnel, a tunneling
  daemon that proxies traffic from the Cloudflare network to your origins.

  This daemon sits between Cloudflare network and your origin (e.g. a
  webserver). Cloudflare attracts client requests and sends them to you
  via this daemon, without requiring you to poke holes on your firewall
  --- your origin can remain as closed as possible.
