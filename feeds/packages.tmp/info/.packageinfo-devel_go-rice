Description:   go.rice is a Go package that makes working with resources such as
  html,js,css,images and templates easy.

  During development go.rice will load required files directly from disk.
  Upon deployment it's easy to add all resource files to a executable
  using the rice tool without changing the source code for your package.

  go.rice provides methods to add resources to a binary in different scenarios.
