Description:  Conserver is an application that allows multiple users to watch a
 serial console at the same time.  It can log the data, allows users
 to take write-access of a console (one at a time), and has a
 variety of bells and whistles to accentuate that basic
 functionality.  The idea is that conserver will log all your serial
 traffic so you can go back and review why something crashed, look
 at changes (if done on the console), or tie the console logs into a
 monitoring system (just watch the logfiles it creates).  With
 multi-user capabilities you can work on equipment with others,
 mentor, train, etc.  It also does all that client-server stuff so
 that, assuming you have a network connection, you can interact with
 any of the equipment from home or wherever.
