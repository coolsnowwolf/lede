Description:   Delve is a debugger for the Go programming language. The goal of the
  project is to provide a simple, full featured debugging tool for Go.
  Delve should be easy to invoke and easy to use. Chances are if you're
  using a debugger, things aren't going your way. With that in mind,
  Delve should stay out of your way as much as possible.
