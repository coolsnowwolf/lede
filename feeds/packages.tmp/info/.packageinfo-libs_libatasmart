Description:   This library is supposed to be lean and small and thus
  supports only a subset of the S.M.A.R.T. functionality.
  However, I claim that it implements the relevant part of it.
  If you need full control over all S.M.A.R.T. functionality of
  your hardware please refer to smartmontools.
