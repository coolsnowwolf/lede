Description:  Lua Lanes is a Lua extension library providing the possibility to run
multiple Lua states in parallel. It is intended to be used for optimizing
performance on multicore CPU's and to study ways to make Lua programs
naturally parallel to begin with.

Lanes is included into your software by the regular require "lanes" method.
No C side programming is needed; all APIs are Lua side, and most existing
extension modules should work seamlessly together with the multiple lanes.

Lanes supports Lua 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3
