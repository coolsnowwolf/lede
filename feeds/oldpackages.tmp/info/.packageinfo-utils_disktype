Description: 	The purpose of disktype is to detect the content format of a disk or disk image.
	It knows about common file systems, partition tables, and boot codes.
	The program is written in C and is designed to compile on any modern Unix flavour.
	It is self-contained and in general works without special libraries or headers.
	Some system-dependant features can be used to gather additional information.
