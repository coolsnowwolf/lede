Source: stund_0.96_Aug13.tgz

Description:   The STUN protocol (Simple Traversal of UDP through NATs) is described in the
  IETF RFC 3489, available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3489.txt. It's used to
  help clients behind NAT to tunnel incoming calls through. This server is the
  counterpart to help the client identify the NAT and have it open the proper
  ports for it.
