Title: Daemon to execute Nagios check commands on remote hosts
Maintainer: 
Source: nrpe-2.12.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description: 	The NRPE addon is designed to allow you to execute Nagios plugins on
	remote Linux/Unix machines.  The main reason for doing this is to allow
	Nagios to monitor "local" resources (like CPU load, memory usage, etc.)
	on remote machines.  Since these public resources are not usually
	exposed to external machines, an agent like NRPE must be installed on
	the remote Linux/Unix machines.
