Description: 	IMAPFilter is a mail filtering utility. It connects to remote mail
	servers using the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), sends
	searching queries to the server and processes mailboxes based on the
	results. It can be used to delete, copy, move, flag, etc. messages
	residing in mailboxes at the same or different mail servers. The 4rev1
	and 4 versions of the IMAP protocol are supported.

	IMAPFilter uses the Lua programming language as a configuration and
	extension language.
