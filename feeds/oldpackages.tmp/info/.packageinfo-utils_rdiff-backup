Title: Incremental backup utility
Maintainer: 
Source: rdiff-backup-1.2.8.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description: 	rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, possibly over a
	network. The target directory ends up a copy of the source directory,
	but extra reverse diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that
	target directory, so you can still recover files lost some time ago.
	The idea is to combine the best features of a mirror and an incremental
	backup.
