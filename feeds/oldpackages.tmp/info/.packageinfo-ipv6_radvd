Description: radvd is the router advertisement daemon for IPv6. It listens to router
solicitations and sends router advertisements as described in "Neighbor
Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6)" (RFC 4861).  With these advertisements hosts
can automatically configure their addresses and some other parameters. They also
can choose a default router based on these advertisements.
