Title: An open P2P design for websearch
Maintainer: Obinou <obconseil@gmail.com>
Source: seeks-0.3.4.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:  Seeks is a free and open P2P design and application for enabling social
 websearch. Its specific purpose is to regroup users whose queries
 are similar so they can share both the query results and their
 experience on these results. On this basis, Seeks allows for true
 real-time, decentralized, websearch to emerge.

 In the long term, there is no need for web crawlers and third-party
 web indexes as users can push content directly to search groups.
 By hashing queries, Seeks offers a unique solution that allows to
 issue queries and get answers while not revealing the true query itself.

 Seeks is currently under development. Code is available from our git
 repository. Help on any of the social, technical and software matters
 is greatly encouraged and appreciated, see the dedicated page.
