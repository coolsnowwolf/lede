Source: time-1.7.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:   `time' is a program that measures many of the CPU resources, such as time and
  memory, that other programs use.  The GNU version can format the output in
  arbitrary ways by using a printf-style format string to include various
  resource measurements.  Some systems do not provide much information about
  program resource use; `time' reports unavailable information as zero values.
