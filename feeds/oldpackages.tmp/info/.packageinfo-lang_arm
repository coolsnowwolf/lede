Title: Terminal status monitor for Tor relays
Maintainer: 
Source: arm-1.4.5.0.tar.bz2
Type: ipkg
Description:   Command line application for monitoring Tor, providing real time status
  information such as the current configuration, bandwidth usage, message log,
  connections, etc. This uses a curses interface much like 'top' does for system
  usage. The application is intended for command-line aficionados, ssh
  connections, and anyone with a tty terminal for checking their relay's status.
