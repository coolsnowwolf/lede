Description:         hping is a command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer. The interface is
        inspired to the ping(8) unix command, but hping isn't only able to send ICMP echo
        requests. It supports TCP, UDP, ICMP and RAW-IP protocols, has a traceroute mode, the
        ability to send files between a covered channel, and many other features.
