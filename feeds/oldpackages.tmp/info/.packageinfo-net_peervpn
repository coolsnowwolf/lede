Maintainer: 
Source: peervpn-0-036.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:   PeerVPN is software that builds virtual ethernet networks between multiple
  computers. Adding a new node to an existing network doesn't require the
  existing nodes to alter their configuration, because its IP address is
  automatically distributed across the whole virtual network.
