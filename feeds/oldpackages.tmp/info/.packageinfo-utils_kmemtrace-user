Title: trace slab allocator functions
Maintainer: 
Source: kmemtrace-user-20100102.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Kernel-Config: CONFIG_KMEMTRACE=y
Description:  kmemtrace provides tracing for slab allocator functions, such as
 kmalloc, kfree, kmem_cache_alloc, kmem_cache_free etc.. Collected
 data is then fed to the userspace application in order to analyse
 allocation hotspots, internal fragmentation and so on, making it
 possible to see how well an allocator performs, as well as debug
 and profile kernel code.
