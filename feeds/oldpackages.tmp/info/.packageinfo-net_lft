Source: lft-3.32.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description: 		LFT, short for Layer Four Traceroute, is a sort of 'traceroute' that
	often works much faster (than the commonly-used Van Jacobson method)
	and goes through many configurations of packet-filters (firewalls).
	More importantly, LFT implements numerous other features including AS
	number lookups through several reliable sources, loose source routing,
	netblock name lookups, et al.
	This package contains the lft 'traceroute' program.
