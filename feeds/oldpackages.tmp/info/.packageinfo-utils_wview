Description:   Wview is a collection of linux/unix daemons which interface with a supported
  weather station to retrieve archive records (if generated by the station) and
  current conditions. If the station does not generate archive records
  internally, wview will auto-generate archive records based on the sensor
  readings collected for that interval. The archive records and High/Low (HILOW)
  data are stored in SQLite3 databases. At a configurable interval, wview will
  utilize the archive history and current conditions to generate weather images
  (buckets, dials and graphs) and HTML web pages based on user-configurable HTML
  templates.

  After install you need to create a directory holding archive and create the
  database there by running there
    sqlite3 wview-archive.sdb '.read /etc/wview/wview-archive.sql'

  Then copy all your theme files to the appropriate place (on a non-volatile
  storage), and html-templates.conf to /etc/wview/; then wviewconfig to configure
  the system.

  Read and amend /etc/init.d/wview appropriately for your particular setup!
