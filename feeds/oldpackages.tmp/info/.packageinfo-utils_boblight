Title: Tools for driving lights connected to an external controller (constant color client)
Maintainer: 
Source: boblight-478.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:     Its main purpose is to create light effects from an external input, such as a
  video stream (desktop capture, video player, tv card), an audio stream (jack,
  alsa), or user input (lirc, http). Currently it only handles video input by
  desktop capture with xlib, video capture from v4l/v4l2 devices and user input
  from the commandline with boblight-constant.

  Boblight uses a client/server model, where clients are responsible for
  translating an external input to light data, and boblightd is responsible for
  translating the light data into commands for external light controllers.

  This package contains the boblight constant color client.
