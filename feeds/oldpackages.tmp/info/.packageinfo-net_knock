Title: Port-knocking (client)
Maintainer: 
Source: knock-0.5.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:   	It listens to all traffic on an ethernet (or PPP) interface,
	looking for special "knock" sequences of port-hits. A client
	makes these port-hits by sending a TCP (or UDP) packet to a
	port on the server. This port need not be open -- since
	knockd listens at the link-layer level, it sees all traffic
	even if it's destined for a closed port. When the server
	detects a specific sequence of port-hits, it runs a command
	defined in its configuration file. This can be used to open
	up holes in a firewall for quick access.
  This package contains the port-knocking client.
