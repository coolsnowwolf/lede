Type: ipkg
Description: 	rssh is a restricted shell for use with OpenSSH, allowing only scp and/or sftp.
	It now also includes support for rdist, rsync, and cvs. For example, if you have
	a server which you only want to allow users to copy files off of via scp, without
	providing shell access, you can use rssh to do that.
