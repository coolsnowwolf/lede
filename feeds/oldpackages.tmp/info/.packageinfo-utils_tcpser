Title: Hayes compatible modem emulator
Maintainer: 
Source: tcpser-1.0rc12.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:  TCPSER turns a PC serial port into an emulated Hayes compatible modem
 that uses TCP/IP for incoming and outgoing connections. It can be used
 to allow older applications and systems designed for modem use
 to operate on the Internet. TCPSER supports all standard Hayes commands,
 and understands extended and vendor proprietary commands (though it does
 not implement many of them). TCPSER can be used for both inbound and
 outbound connections.
