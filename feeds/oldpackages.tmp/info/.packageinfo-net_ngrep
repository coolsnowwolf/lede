Description: 	ngrep a pcap-aware tool that will allow you to specify extended
	regular expressions to match against data payloads of packets. It
	currently recognizes TCP, UDP, and ICMP across Ethernet, PPP, SLIP,
	FDDI, Token Ring and null interfaces, and understands BPF filter
	logic in the same fashion as more common packet sniffing tools,
	like tcpdump and snoop.
