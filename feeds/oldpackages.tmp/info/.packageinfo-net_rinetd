Source: rinetd.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:   Rinetd redirects TCP connections from one IP address and port to another.
  Rinetd is a single-process server which handles any number of connections
  to the address/port pairs specified in the configuration.
  Since rinetd runs as a single process using nonblocking I/O, it is able to
  redirect a large number of connections without a severe impact on the
  machine.
