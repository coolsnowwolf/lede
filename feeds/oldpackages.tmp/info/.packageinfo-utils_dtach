Title: A program that emulates the dtach feature of screen
Maintainer: 
Source: dtach-0.8.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description: 	dtach is a tiny program that emulates the detach feature of screen,
	allowing you to run a program in an environment that is protected from
	the controlling terminal and attach to it later. dtach does not keep
	track of the contents of the screen, and thus works best with programs
	that know how to redraw themselves.
