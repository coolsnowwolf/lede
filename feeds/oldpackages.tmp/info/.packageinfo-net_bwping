Source: bwping-1.4.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:   BWPing is a bandwidth measurement tool based on ICMP echo
  request/reply.  It is especially well suited for lossy links. BWPing
  does not not require any special software on the remote host (only
  the ability to respond on ICMP echo request messages).
