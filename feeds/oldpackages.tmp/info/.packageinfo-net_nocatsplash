Description: 	NoCatSplash is an Open Public Network Gateway Daemon.
	It performs as a [captive/open/active] portal. When run on a gateway/router
	on a network, all web requests are redirected until the client either logs
	in or clicks "I Accept" to an AUP. The gateway daemon then changes the
	firewall rules on the gateway to pass traffic for that client (based on IP
	address and MAC address).
