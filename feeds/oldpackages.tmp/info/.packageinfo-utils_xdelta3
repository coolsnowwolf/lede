Description:  Xdelta3 is a set of tools designed to compute changes between binary
 files. These changes (delta files) are similar to the output of the
 "diff" program, in that they may be used to store and transmit only
 the changes between files. The "delta files" that Xdelta3 manages are
 stored in RFC3284 (VCDIFF) format.
