Title: The Ultimate Packer for eXecutables
Maintainer: 
Source: upx-3.08-src.tar.bz2
Type: ipkg
Description: UPX is a free, portable, extendable, high-performance executable packer for
several different executable formats. It achieves an excellent compression ratio
and offers very fast decompression. Your executables suffer no memory overhead
or other drawbacks for most of the formats supported, because of in-place
decompression.
