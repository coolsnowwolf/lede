		default n
		help
		  This option changes several defaults to be more suitable for
		  automatic builds. This includes the following changes:
		  - Deleting build directories after compiling (to save space)
		  - Enabling per-device rootfs support
		  ...

	config BUILD_PATENTED
		default n
		bool "Compile with support for patented functionality"
		help
		  When this option is disabled, software which provides patented functionality
		  will not be built.  In case software provides optional support for patented
		  functionality, this optional support will get disabled for this package.

	config BUILD_NLS
		default n
		bool "Compile with full language support"
		help
		  When this option is enabled, packages are built with the full versions of
		  iconv and GNU gettext instead of the default OpenWrt stubs. If uClibc is

		  This makes file checksums part of package metadata. It increases size
		  but provides you with pkg_check command to check for flash coruptions.

		default BUILDBOT
		help
		  This collects debugging symbols from the kernel and all compiled modules.
		  Useful for release builds, so that kernel issues can be debugged offline
		  later.

	config STRIP_KERNEL_EXPORTS
		bool "Strip unnecessary exports from the kernel image"
		help
		  Reduces kernel size by stripping unused kernel exports from the kernel
		  image.  Note that this might make the kernel incompatible with any kernel
		  modules that were not selected at the time the kernel image was created.

	config USE_MKLIBS
		bool "Strip unnecessary functions from libraries"
		help
		  Reduces libraries to only those functions that are necessary for using all
		  selected packages (including those selected as <M>).  Note that this will
		  make the system libraries incompatible with most of the packages that are
		  not selected during the build process.

		  Add -fPIC to CFLAGS and -specs=hardened-build-ld to LDFLAGS.
		  This enables package build as Position Independent Executables (PIE)
		  to protect against "return-to-text" attacks. This belongs to the
		  feature of Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR), which is
		  implemented by the kernel and the ELF loader by randomising the
		  location of memory allocations. This makes memory addresses harder
		  to predict when an attacker is attempting a memory-corruption exploit.
		  You can disable this per package by adding PKG_ASLR_PIE:=0 in the package
		  Makefile.
		  Be ware that ASLR increases the binary size.
		config PKG_ASLR_PIE_NONE
